to CodeReflections, a blog dedicated to exploring programming\nlanguages, tools, and best practices.  I'm looking forward to posting about\ntopics of interest to me, and I hope you find them interesting too!\n\nI've been wanting to create a blog like this for many years now, and finally\ngot around to doing it. Better late than never, right?\nSince this is an introductory post, I'll try to describe what to expect from\nthis blog.  Currently, I'm expecting that Perl and Rust will likely be the\nprimary focus of this blog, simply because both languages are of special\ninterest to me.  Of course, this may change over time, and I certainly won't\nhesitate to post about other topics of interest to me.  I've always been a\nprogramming polyglot, having used dozens of languages over the years, so\nanything goes!\nPerl has been my favorite programming language for well over 30 years now.\nWhile I can't pin down precisely when I started using Perl, my best estimate\nwould be sometime in 1989 or so.  I know for certain that I was using Perl in\nearly 1990, and by early 1991 it was my favorite programming language and an\nindispensable tool for me.  (There's a story there which I'll save for a future\nblog post.)\nRust is a more recent passion for me.  I started looking into Rust in 2019, and\nquickly became very interested.  I'll get into more detail later, but suffice\nit to say that apart from Raku (née Perl 6), Rust is the first language I've\nfound that feels like it has the potential to displace Perl as my favorite\nprogramming language.  It hasn't happened yet, but it's a distinct possibility.\nOne of my favorite quotes comes from Alan Kay: \"Simple things should be simple,\nand complex things should be possible.\"  This has always been my philosophy\nabout programming in general, so I made it the tagline for this blog.\nLately, I've been experimenting with ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by\nOpenAI.  It's a fascinating tool which is surprisingly capable and intelligent\non the one hand, yet surprisingly dumb or hallucinatory at times as well.  It\ncan be a very useful tool, but it should not be trusted blindly.  Still, it's\nnothing like conversations with Eliza back in the day; ChatGPT could probably\npass the Turing Test!\nIn the process of creating this blog, I've been using ChatGPT as a tool to help\nwith research, brainstorming and also just as a sounding board to bounce ideas\noff of.  (That's really an odd turn of phrase, isn't it?)  Consider this a\ndisclaimer that ChatGPT may be used as a tool when creating any of the content\non this blog, but rest assured that the thoughts and opinions here are my own.\nI won't hesitate to discard or rewrite anything ChatGPT suggests.\nFor example, I told ChatGPT to \"Help me write the first post for the blog.\"\nI wanted to see what it would come up with, and use it as a starting point to\nwork from.  For the sake of transparency, here is the exact draft that ChatGPT\ngave me in response:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHelp me write the first post for the blog.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTitle: Welcome to CodeReflections: A Journey in Programming\nHello, fellow programmers and tech enthusiasts! Welcome to CodeReflections, a\nblog dedicated to exploring programming languages, tools, and best practices.\nI'm thrilled to embark on this journey with you all, and I hope that together\nwe can learn, grow, and share our passion for programming.\nTo kick things off, let's talk about the purpose of this blog and what you\ncan expect to find here. CodeReflections is primarily focused on Perl and\nRust, two languages I personally love working with. However, as a programming\npolyglot, I won't limit the discussion to just these two languages. You can\nexpect to see content related to various programming languages, tools,\nlibraries, and techniques.\nAs Alan Kay once said, \"Simple things should be simple, and complex things\nshould be possible.\" This quote perfectly encapsulates the philosophy behind\nthis blog. I believe that good programming practices should enable us to make\nsimple tasks simple and give us the tools to tackle complex challenges when\nneeded.\nHere's what you can expect from CodeReflections:\nTutorials and Guides: Easy-to-follow explanations and practical examples to\nhelp you learn new concepts, tools, and libraries.\nCode Optimization: Tips and tricks for writing efficient, elegant, and\nmaintainable code.\nLanguage Comparisons: Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of different\nprogramming languages and how they can be utilized in various projects.\nBest Practices: Discussions on design patterns, testing methodologies, and\nother practices to help you become a better programmer.\nPersonal Insights: As I explore new languages, tools, and techniques, I'll\nshare my thoughts and experiences in hopes that they might resonate with you\nor spark a conversation.\nIn the spirit of open-source, I welcome contributions and discussions from\nthe community. If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions, feel free\nto leave a comment or reach out to me via social media.\nThank you for joining me on this adventure, and I look forward to our future\ndiscussions on CodeReflections.\nHappy coding!\n      \n    \n  \n\nPretty good, right?  Honestly, I don't disagree with anything above, but it\nstill sounds a bit generic to me.  As you can see, I've deviated quite a bit\nfrom this suggested draft.  While ChatGPT's suggestions sound fine to me\n(Tutorials and Guides, Code Optimization, Language Comparisons, Best Practices\nand Personal Insights), I don't know how accurate that list might be.  Time\nwill tell.\nI figure that I might as well explore reasonable monetization options for this\nblog.  I'm not going to hold my breath hoping to make a living as a blogger,\nbut every little bit helps, right?  It's worth a try, so I instructed ChatGPT:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAdd a paragraph with a suitable disclosure for possible monetization (e.g.\nads/affiliate links/sponsorships) and use of ChatGPT.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn the interest of transparency, I want to inform you that CodeReflections\nmay be monetized in the future through advertisements, affiliate links, and\nsponsorships. These monetization methods help support the creation and\nmaintenance of this blog. Any such content will always be clearly identified,\nand I promise to maintain a high standard of quality in my posts. Rest\nassured that my priority is to provide valuable and unbiased content to my\nreaders. Additionally, some of the content on this blog, including this post,\nhas been drafted with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model\ndeveloped by OpenAI. This tool aids me in generating ideas and refining the\ncontent, but the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSure, I guess this works.  No notes.\nThat's enough for now.  As ChatGPT said: Happy coding!\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/18/welcome-to-codereflections/","title":"Welcome to CodeReflections!"},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/":{"body":"How did I choose CodeReflections as the name for this blog?  With some help\nfrom ChatGPT!\nI always dread trying to think of a good name for a new project, because I'm\nmuch better at rejecting name ideas than thinking of one I actually like and\ncan use.  Having already decided to use ChatGPT as a tool to help with this\nblog, I figured it could help me brainstorm to find a good name for the blog.\nIt was a very long conversation with ChatGPT (GPT-4 model), but it was\nultimately successful.\n\nHere's how it went:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nI need to think of a good name for the blog.  I've been programming Perl since\n1989 and it's been my favorite language almost since the beginning, but I've\nbeen extremely interested in Rust for the last few years and it's the one\nlanguage (besides Perl 6/Raku) that feels like it could potentially take the\nplace of Perl as my favorite language.  (It hasn't yet, but it seems to have\nthe potential.)  Perl and Rust are the two languages I would be most likely to\nbe blogging about, although I've probably used dozens of different languages\nover the years.  Also, one of my favorite quotes is \"Simple things should be\nsimple, complex things should be possible.\"  (I'm sure you know who said that.)\nPerhaps it could be used as a tagline?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nBased on your interests and the quote you mentioned, here are some suggestions\nfor your blog name:\n\nPerlsOfRust.com - A play on the phrase \"pearls of wisdom\" that highlights\nyour expertise in both Perl and Rust.\nRustyPerlGuru.com - Combining your love for Perl and Rust while showcasing\nyour expertise.\nTwoLanguagesOnePassion.com - Emphasizing your passion for both Perl and\nRust.\nSimpleAndPossible.com - Derived from the quote you mentioned, focusing on\nthe simplicity and possibilities of Perl and Rust.\nustyPerlsOfWisdom.com - A combination of the play on \"pearls of wisdom\" and\nyour interest in Rust.\nFromPerlToRust.com - Documenting your journey and experiences in both Perl\nand Rust.\nPerlandRustAdventures.com - Showcasing your adventures and experiences in\nthe world of Perl and Rust.\n\nFor the tagline, you can use the quote you mentioned, perhaps with a small\nadaptation:\n\"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible - Adventures\nin Perl and Rust\"\nRemember to check the availability of the domain names and make sure they are\nnot taken or trademarked by someone else.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nA name that works well for Perl and Rust would be good but I don't necessarily\nwant to bind the name too closely to either language in case my interests\nchange or the focus of the blog changes.  Something related somehow to that\nquote might work better.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nUnderstood. Here are some more blog name suggestions that are inspired by the\nquote and not tied directly to Perl or Rust, allowing for flexibility in your\ncontent:\n\nSimpleAndPossible.com - Directly derived from the quote, emphasizing\nsimplicity and possibility in programming.\nCodingElegance.com - A focus on elegant and efficient coding practices\nacross various languages.\nTheEfficientCoder.com - Highlighting your expertise in making simple and\ncomplex tasks possible in programming.\nCodeVersatility.com - A nod to your experience with numerous programming\nlanguages and ability to adapt.\nAgileSyntax.com - Combining the idea of simplicity with your adaptability\nacross multiple languages.\nTheFlexibleProgrammer.com - Emphasizing your ability to work with different\nlanguages and cater to a variety of projects.\n\nFor the tagline, you can still use the quote or a variation of it to emphasize\nyour core philosophy:\n\"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible - Exploring\nthe art of programming\"\nRemember to check domain availability and ensure that the names are not already\ntaken or trademarked.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nWho is that quote from?  I may also be interested in writing blog posts about\npersonal or political topics, but I'm thinking that should be in a completely\nseparate blog, no?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nThe quote \"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible\"\nis attributed to Alan Kay, a computer scientist known for his pioneering work\non object-oriented programming and the development of the Smalltalk programming\nlanguage.\nAs for writing about personal or political topics, it's generally a good idea\nto separate those from a technical programming blog. Keeping them separate\nallows you to maintain a focused theme for each blog, catering to the interests\nof different target audiences.\nYou can create a second blog for your personal and political posts and link it\nin your author bio or \"About\" page on your programming blog. This way, readers\nwho are interested in your non-technical thoughts can easily find your other\nblog without it distracting from the programming content.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nMakes sense.  I always struggle with coming up with good names for projects.\nGive me a large list of additional suggestions.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nCertainly!

Here's my thoughts\non using various names you've suggested:\n\nSimpleAndPossible.com - Too obvious.\nCodingElegance.com - Not bad I guess, but it seems to have the potential to\ncome across as arrogant.  Also, a domain squatter owns that domain.\nTheEfficientCoder.com - Nope, doesn't feel right.\nCodeVersatility.com - Sounds almost too generic.\nAgileSyntax.com - Nothing wrong with agile programming, though it won't\nnecessarily be a focus.  Combining it with \"syntax\" just sounds weird though.\nTheFlexibleProgrammer.com - Meh.  Flexibility is good though.\n\nFrom the next list:\n\nCodeSimplicity.com - On the fence about this one, but I like the concept\nagain.\nElegantSolutions.dev - Again, I like the concepts of elegance and solving\nproblems, but this again seems potentially arrogant-sounding as well.\nComplexityMadeSimple.com - I like the connection to the quote, and the idea\nof the blog being able to help readers grasp complex things and make them\nsimple, but this name still doesn't work for me.\nTheAdaptableCoder.com - I'm not sure I want to refer to myself as\n\"Programmer\" or \"Coder\" for the name because I don't want the blog to be about\nme, per se.  Adaptability is a good concept though.\nInfiniteCodingPossibilities.com - Nice idea, still not working for me.\nCodeAlchemy.io - Nope.\nEffortlessProgramming.com - No, good programming often does require\nsignificant effort.\nFluidCodeSolutions.com - Nope, but good ideas.\nUniversalCoder.net - Interesting, but no.\nPolyglotProgrammer.dev - I kinda like it and it does describe me, but\nagain, I'm not the focus of the blog.\nTheCodingPhilosopher.com - Hmm, I do like this one and the philosophy\naspect.  This exact name has another domain squatter but I like the direction\nanyhow.\nThePragmaticCoder.com - Interesting but no.\nAbstractedLogic.com - Not sure what to think of this one, might be too far\nafield.\nMasteringCodeCraft.com - I like the mastery and craftsmanship concepts but\nthis feels like it's promising something, and again potentially arrogant?\nTheArtOfCode.dev - I do like this one, but still not quite working for me.\nInnovativeSyntax.com - Nope.\nCodeWanderer.io - Cute but no.\nThoughtfulProgramming.com - Not quote, but something relating to thoughts\nor musings about programming might have possibilities.\nCerebralCoding.com - Too high-brow.\nLanguageAgnosticCoder.com - Definitely not.  I've worked with many\nprogramming languages but I'm not agnostic about them.  On the contrary, I have\nstrong preferences.\nSeamlessProgramming.io - Nope.\nCodePioneers.net - Nope.\nTheCodingCompass.com - Nope.\nFluidLogic.dev - Nope.\nBeyondTheCode.io - Nope.\nTheCodingOdysey.com - While \"odyssey\" is a bit interesting, still no.\nTheBalancedProgrammer.com - Balance is a good thing too, but still no.\nCodeFinesse.net - Finesse is also a good concept, but I don't think so.\nTheExpressiveCoder.com - Sounds too much about me again and doesn't feel\nright either.\nUniversalSyntax.dev - Doesn't make sense to me.  I think using \"syntax\" in\nthe name would be hard to make work, to be honest.\nTranscendingCode.com - Nope.\nCodeWisdom.io - No, sounds too arrogant again.  I may have strong opinions\nabout programming but I don't know that I want to be declaring that my opinions\nqualify as \"wisdom\".\nTheEloquentCoder.com - Again, eloquence is a good concept, but this doesn't\nwork either.\nTheVersatileDeveloper.com - Versatility is another good concept, but again,\nit's not about me.\nIntuitiveProgramming.net - Intuitive is another good concept but this\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nThank you for the detailed feedback!

I have\nsuccessfully registered that domain name.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nCongratulations on registering your domain name, codereflections.com!

These pages\nprovide information about you, your blog, and how visitors can get in touch\nwith you.\nPlan your content: Develop a content strategy that outlines the topics\nyou'll cover, the types of content you'll create (e.g., tutorials, opinion\npieces, reviews), and a rough publishing schedule.\nWrite and publish your first blog post: Write an introductory post that\nwelcomes visitors to your blog and gives them an idea of what to expect from\nyour future content. Be sure to optimize your content for search engines by\nusing relevant keywords, adding meta descriptions, and using headings.\nPromote your blog: Share your posts on social media, engage with other\nbloggers in your niche, and participate in relevant online communities to\ndrive traffic to your blog.\nMonitor your blog's performance: Use tools like Google Analytics to track\nyour blog's traffic, user engagement, and other key performance indicators.\nThis data will help you make informed decisions about your content strategy\nand promotional efforts.\n\nRemember, building a successful blog takes time and consistent effort. Keep\ncreating valuable content for your readers, and over time, you will see your\nblog grow and attract a loyal audience. Good luck with your new programming\nblog!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nAre you able to help with graphic design to create a cool logo for the blog?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nAs an AI language model, I am unable to create visual content directly.\nHowever, I can help guide you through the process of designing a logo or\nprovide suggestions on what elements to include in your logo to make it unique\nand appealing.\nHere are some tips to consider when creating a logo for your blog:\n\nKeep it simple: A simple logo is often more memorable and easier to\nrecognize.  Stick to a few essential elements that represent your blog's theme\nor your programming interests.\nChoose the right colors: Colors can evoke emotions and create associations.\nChoose colors that complement your blog's theme and resonate with your target\naudience. For example, you might use blue to represent trust and\nprofessionalism, or green for growth and creativity.\nUse typography wisely: Choose a font that is legible and complements the\nother elements of your logo. You might consider using a programming-related\nfont, such as a monospace font, to reflect the nature of your blog.\nIncorporate relevant imagery: Consider including a symbol or icon that\nrepresents your blog's focus on programming, such as curly braces, a code\nsnippet, or a stylized representation of a computer or programming language.\nMake it scalable: Your logo should be easy to recognize and look good at\ndifferent sizes, whether it's displayed on a website, social media, or printed\nmaterials.\n\nIf you're not comfortable designing a logo yourself, you have a few options:\n\nHire a professional graphic designer: A professional designer will be able\nto create a high-quality, unique logo that meets your specifications. You can\nfind designers on freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or 99designs.\nUse a logo maker tool: Online logo makers like Canva, Looka, or Tailor\nBrands can help you create a logo using pre-made templates and elements. These\ntools are user-friendly and typically more affordable than hiring a designer.\nCollaborate with a design-savvy friend: If you have a friend or\nacquaintance with design skills, consider asking for their help in exchange for\na favor or a small fee.\n\nRegardless of the method you choose, make sure to take your time and iterate\non your design until you're satisfied with the result. A well-designed logo\ncan make a significant impact on your blog's branding and overall success.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\nLooks like it was luck that \"codereflections.com\" was available.  From\nsearching archive.org, I found that someone used the domain once before for a\nblog in 2009 which had no new posts after September 2009.  It was still online\nin 2011; for years after that, HTTP 302 errors were coming back, and eventually\nit looks like a domain squatter had it as recently as a year or two ago, but\nI guess they gave up and let it expire.  Score!\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\nThat's great to hear! It's always nice to find a domain name that suits your\nneeds and is available, especially when it has some history behind it. Now you\ncan give \"codereflections.com\" a new life with your programming blog. It's an\nexcellent opportunity to create fresh and engaging content for your audience.\nMake sure to take advantage of this and use it to create a successful and\ninformative blog. Good luck with your new blogging endeavor!\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis conversation was very long, and it took hours to get the HTML/CSS working\nto format this conversation nicely, so I'm not going to add any additional\ncommentary.  My next post will continue talking about the process of creating\nthis blog from scratch.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/","title":"What's in a name?"},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/20/how-the-sausage-is-made/":{"body":"Continuing the origin story of this blog, after a long conversation with\nChatGPT, I had settled on a name and was lucky enough to be able to register\nthe \"codereflections.com\" domain.  Next, I had to choose a blogging platform\nand hosting platform.  Should I use WordPress or something else?  I needed to\ndo some research and think about this decision.  ChatGPT was happy to help.\n\nThe need to choose a blogging platform was mentioned in ChatGPT's response to\nmy very first message in the conversation about starting this blog.  Here is\nthat initial exchange; it was immediately followed by the lengthy ChatGPT\nconversation quoted in yesterday's post about\nthe search for a name for the blog:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHelp me start a new programming blog.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nStarting a new programming blog can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are\nsome steps to help you set up and launch your blog successfully:\n\n\nChoose a niche and target audience:\nDetermine the focus of your blog, whether it's a specific programming language,\ntechnology, or concept. This will help you attract a more targeted audience and\nprovide valuable content.\n\n\nSelect a blogging platform:\nChoose a suitable platform to host your blog, such as WordPress, Blogger, or\nMedium. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages, so consider your\nneeds and technical expertise when making your choice.\n\n\nPick a domain name and hosting:\nSelect a domain name that reflects the theme of your blog and is easy to\nremember. Register the domain and sign up for a hosting service to make your\nblog accessible online.\n\n\nCustomize the design:\nChoose a theme or template that aligns with your content and appeals to your\ntarget audience. Customize the design by adding your logo, color scheme, and\nother branding elements.\n\n\nPlan your content:\nCreate a content plan that outlines the topics you'll cover, the frequency of\nyour posts, and the type of content you'll create (tutorials, articles,\nreviews, etc.). A well-structured content plan will help you maintain\nconsistency and keep your audience engaged.\n\n\nWrite high-quality content:\nStart writing informative, engaging, and well-researched articles. Use clear\nlanguage, include relevant code snippets, and provide practical examples to\nillustrate your points. Focus on providing value to your readers and\nestablishing yourself as an expert in your niche.\n\n\nPromote your blog:\nShare your posts on social media, join relevant forums, and participate in\nonline communities to increase your blog's visibility. You can also consider\nguest posting on other blogs or collaborating with fellow programmers to\nreach a\n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\nYes, the response was truncated in the middle of the sentence like that, but I\ndidn't ask ChatGPT to repeat it, so I don't know what the rest of the response\nwas meant to be.  I've found message truncation like this to be a fairly common\nproblem with the chat.openai.com ChatGPT platform.\nResponses from ChatGPT which exceed 2048 bytes in length are truncated.  It's\npossible to work around it, but this rather small length limit is definitely a\nnuisance.  (I'm using ChatGPT Plus; this conversation was using the GPT-4\nmodel.)\nNear the end of the conversation about names, ChatGPT mentioned the blogging\nplatform again:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOkay, enough about names.  I decided to go with \"codereflections.com\".  I have\nsuccessfully registered that domain name.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCongratulations on registering your domain name, codereflections.com! Now that\nyou have the domain, you can start building your programming blog. Here are\nsome steps to help you get started:\n[...]\n\nInstall a Content Management System (CMS): A CMS makes it easy to manage\nand publish content on your blog without the need for extensive technical\nknowledge. WordPress is the most popular CMS, offering a wide range of\nthemes, plugins, and customization options.\n\n[...]\n      \n    \n  \n\nI'm planning to try to monetize this blog in the usual ways, so I threw that\ninto the mix:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat's the best way of starting the blog while making it easy to monetize in\nthe future if I can find an audience?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo start your blog while keeping future monetization options open, follow these\nsteps:\n\n\nChoose a platform: Select a blogging platform that offers flexibility for\nmonetization. WordPress is highly recommended because it's highly customizable\nand offers a variety of plugins for monetization.\n\n\nInvest in hosting and a domain: Purchase a reliable hosting plan and a\ncustom domain name, like the one you've already registered. A custom domain\nwill make your blog appear more professional and easier to monetize.\n\n\nDesign your blog: Create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly blog\ndesign. Use a responsive theme to ensure that your site looks great on all\ndevices. If needed, invest in a premium theme or hire a designer to create a\ncustom design.\n\n\nCreate quality content: Focus on producing high-quality, engaging, and\ninformative content for your readers. This will help you attract an audience\nand keep them coming back for more.\n\n\nPromote your blog: Use social media, networking, guest posting, and other\nmarketing techniques to drive traffic to your blog. The more traffic you have,\nthe more attractive your blog will be to advertisers and potential monetization\npartners.\n\n\nBuild an email list: Start collecting email addresses from your visitors.\nAn email list can be an essential tool for promoting your content and\nmonetizing your blog.\n\n\nPlan for monetization: Research and plan for various monetization methods,\nsuch as affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, display ads, and selling digital\nproducts or services. As your audience grows, you can start implementing these\nmethods.\n\n\nTrack your progress: Use analytics tools like Google Analytics to track\nyour blog's performance. This will help you make data-driven decisions about\nyour content strategy and monetization efforts.\n\n\nEngage with your audience: Respond to comments and interact with your\nreaders on social media. Building a loyal and engaged audience will make it\neasier to monetize your blog in the future.\n\n\nBe patient and persistent: Building a successful blog takes time and\neffort. Be patient, keep learning, and stay consistent with your content and\npromotional efforts. As your audience grows, monetization opportunities will\nfollow.\n\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be well on your way to creating a blog that is\nnot only engaging and informative but also has the potential for monetization\nin the future.\n      \n    \n  \n\nObviously, WordPress is the 800-pound gorilla in the room.  It's what everyone\nseems to recommend and what most people seem to use.  According to\nwordpress.com, \"42% of the web is built on\nWordPress.\"  I don't know how accurate that is, but there are probably tens of\nmillions of WordPress blogs out there.\nI'm sure there are a lot of good reasons to consider using WordPress, and maybe\nI'll have a compelling reason to use it in the future.  For now, I'm avoiding\nusing WordPress.  It's written in PHP, which is a language I really dislike.\nIt's also a dynamic website, so the performance could be slow.  Despite being\nable to theoretically use WordPress for free, it does appear to have a lot of\npotential costs associated with it.  I won't rule it out for the future, but I\ndidn't want to start with WordPress, so I steered the conversation away from\nthat option.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI don't want to use WordPress.  It's written in PHP and PHP sucks.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf you don't want to use WordPress, there are several other blogging platforms\nand content management systems (CMS) to choose from. Some popular alternatives\ninclude:\n\n\nGhost (https://ghost.org/): Ghost is a modern and open-source platform\ndesigned for bloggers and writers. It is built on Node.js and offers a clean\nand minimalistic user interface. It's easy to use and has built-in SEO\nfeatures.\n\n\nJekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/): Jekyll is a static site generator\nwritten in Ruby. It's ideal for developers who prefer a lightweight platform\nand want to use Markdown for writing content. You can host your Jekyll blog on\nGitHub Pages for free or on any web server that supports static files.\n\n\nHugo (https://gohugo.io/): Hugo is another static site generator, but\nit's written in Go. It's known for its speed and flexibility. You can host\nyour Hugo blog on various platforms, including Netlify, Vercel, or any web\nserver that supports static files.\n\n\nGatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): Gatsby is a React-based,\nopen-source framework for building websites and applications. It generates\nstatic files but can also work with dynamic content through APIs.  Gatsby\nintegrates well with various headless CMS options like Contentful, Strapi, or\nDatoCMS.\n\n\nNetlify CMS (https://www.netlifycms.org/): Netlify CMS is an\nopen-source content management system that works with static site generators\nlike Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. It provides an easy-to-use interface for\nmanaging your content and can be hosted on Netlify or other hosting providers\nthat support static files.\n\n\nWhen choosing an alternative to WordPress, consider the features, flexibility,\nand ease of use that each platform offers. Some platforms may require more\ntechnical knowledge than others, but they can provide a more customizable and\nlightweight solution for your blog.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre there any implemented in Rust?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there are some static site generators and blogging platforms implemented\nin Rust. Some popular options include:\n\n\nZola (https://www.getzola.org/): Zola is a fast static site generator\nwritten in Rust. It offers features such as shortcodes, themes, and Sass\ncompilation out of the box. It also supports various templating languages like\nTera and Markdown for content creation. Zola is a great option if you're\nlooking for a Rust-based alternative to Jekyll or Hugo.\n\n\nCobalt (https://cobalt-org.github.io/): Cobalt is another static site\ngenerator written in Rust. It supports Liquid templates and provides basic\nfeatures like tags, categories, and pagination. Cobalt is a lightweight option\nfor creating simple blogs or websites.\n\n\nGutenberg (https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg): Gutenberg is a static\nsite generator in Rust that offers features like live reloading and Sass\ncompilation. However, it is no longer actively maintained, and the project has\nbeen archived on GitHub. You might want to consider Zola instead, which is\nactively maintained and offers similar features.\n\n\nWhen using a Rust-based platform, keep in mind that you'll need to have Rust\ninstalled on your system to build and generate your site. Additionally, you can\nhost your generated static files on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or\nVercel.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nStatic site generator?  Will that make it somewhat limiting?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing a static site generator can have some limitations compared to a dynamic\ncontent management system like WordPress. However, for a programming blog, a\nstatic site generator is often more than enough to meet your needs. Some points\nto consider:\n\n\nPerformance: Static site generators create pre-rendered HTML files, which\nleads to faster load times and a better user experience. You don't need to\nworry about server-side rendering, as the files are served directly to the\nuser.\n\n\nSecurity: Since static sites don't rely on a database or server-side\nprocessing, they are less prone to security vulnerabilities like SQL injections\nand other attacks.\n\n\nMaintenance: Static site generators require less maintenance and updates\ncompared to dynamic CMS platforms. You don't need to worry about updating\nplugins, themes, or the platform itself.\n\n\nCost: Hosting static sites is often cheaper and easier because you don't\nneed a complex server infrastructure. You can use platforms like GitHub\nPages, Netlify, or Vercel, which offer free hosting for static sites.\n\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to consider:\n\n\nDynamic features: Implementing features like real-time comments, search, or\nuser accounts can be more challenging with static sites. However, you can still\nintegrate third-party services like Disqus for comments or Algolia for search\nfunctionality.\n\n\nContent updates: With static site generators, you need to rebuild and\nredeploy your site every time you make changes or add new content. This can be\na bit time-consuming, especially for larger sites. However, this is usually not\nan issue for personal blogs with occasional updates.\n\n\nLearning curve: If you're not familiar with the static site generator's\nsyntax, templating language, or build process, there may be a learning curve\ninvolved.  However, this can also be an opportunity to learn new technologies\nand improve your skills.\n\n\nIn conclusion, a static site generator may have some limitations, but for a\nprogramming blog, it can be an excellent choice. It offers simplicity,\nperformance, and security benefits that can outweigh the limitations,\nespecially if you're willing to work around them or use third-party services to\nenhance your site's functionality.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI wanted to explore the possibility of hosting the site on GitHub Pages for\nfree, so I explored that too:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nJekyll blogs can be hosted on GitHub Pages for free, is Jekyll the only option\nfor the free hosting?  If hosted that way, can it still be monetized?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nJekyll is not the only option for free hosting on GitHub Pages. You can use\nother static site generators as well, such as Hugo, Gatsby, 11ty, Hexo, or\nPelican, to name a few. The key is to generate the static HTML files that you\ncan then host on GitHub Pages.\nYes, you can still monetize a blog hosted on GitHub Pages. Monetization\noptions, such as running ads, promoting affiliate products, or offering\nsponsored content, are not tied to the hosting platform but rather to the\ncontent and structure of your site. Some common monetization methods for static\nsites include:\n\n\nAffiliate marketing: You can join affiliate programs and include affiliate\nlinks in your blog posts. When users click on these links and make a purchase,\nyou'll earn a commission.\n\n\nDisplay ads: You can sign up for an ad network like Google AdSense and\ndisplay ads on your site. You'll earn revenue based on the number of\nimpressions or clicks the ads receive.\n\n\nSponsored content: You can collaborate with companies or other content\ncreators to create sponsored blog posts, reviews, or tutorials.\n\n\nSell digital products or services: You can create and sell ebooks, online\ncourses, or offer consulting services related to your blog's niche.\n\n\nDonations or memberships: You can ask your audience for support through\ndonations using platforms like Patreon, Ko-fi, or by offering premium content\nor access to a members-only community.\n\n\nTo implement these monetization methods, you'll need to add the necessary HTML,\nJavaScript, or third-party integrations to your static site generator's\ntemplates or content files. This can usually be done with most static site\ngenerators, including those that can be hosted on GitHub Pages.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nGitHub doesn't have any terms of service prohibiting monetization of a blog\nhosted for free?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGitHub does not have specific terms of service prohibiting the monetization of\na blog hosted on GitHub Pages. According to their terms of service, GitHub\nPages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages.\nHowever, there are some guidelines you should follow to ensure that you comply\nwith their terms:\n\n\nGitHub Pages should not be used for commercial purposes, like running an\nonline store. Monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or sponsored content is\ngenerally acceptable, as long as the primary purpose of your blog is to provide\ncontent and not solely to generate revenue.\n\n\nGitHub Pages should not be used for hosting activities that violate the\nGitHub Acceptable Use Policies, such as distributing spam, hosting illegal\ncontent, or engaging in activities that interfere with the operation of\nGitHub's services.\n\n\nGitHub Pages sources must be stored in a public repository, so be mindful of\nthe content you store and the privacy of any sensitive information.\n\n\nDon't overuse resources. GitHub Pages is a free service, and excessive use\nof resources could potentially result in throttling or suspension of your site.\n\n\nIt's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with GitHub's Terms of Service\nand Acceptable Use Policies to ensure that you are in compliance. If you are\never unsure about whether your blog's monetization strategy complies with\nGitHub's terms, you can always reach out to their support team for\nclarification.\nRemember that if you ever feel limited by GitHub Pages or concerned about\ncompliance, there are other free or affordable hosting options available, like\nNetlify or Vercel, that can also host static sites generated with Jekyll or\nother static site generators.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nExcessive use of resources?  What if there were a lot of visitors to the site?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGitHub Pages is designed to handle a reasonable amount of traffic for personal,\norganization, or project pages. However, it is not intended to support\nextremely high levels of traffic, like those of a popular commercial website.\nIn practice, most personal blogs and projects hosted on GitHub Pages do not\nexperience any issues with traffic.\nIf your blog becomes very popular and starts to receive a large amount of\ntraffic, GitHub may throttle or limit the resources allocated to your site. In\nsuch a case, you might need to consider moving to a different hosting provider\nthat can better accommodate your needs.\nAlternatives like Netlify or Vercel are well-suited to handle higher levels of\ntraffic for static sites, and they offer free plans with generous resource\nallocations. Additionally, these platforms provide scalable paid plans to\naccommodate further growth.\nIt's essential to monitor your site's traffic and performance, and if you\nnotice any issues, consider upgrading to a more robust hosting solution that\ncan handle the increased demand.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSuppose I use one of the static site generators and host it on GitHub Pages.\nShould I have a separate GitHub account for the site?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's not strictly necessary to create a separate GitHub account for your blog\nhosted on GitHub Pages. You can host your blog using your existing GitHub\naccount, under a new repository. However, there are some potential benefits to\ncreating a separate account specifically for your blog:\n\n\nOrganization: Having a separate account for your blog can help keep your\npersonal projects and blog content separate and organized.\n\n\nPrivacy: Using a separate account allows you to maintain a certain level\nof privacy for your personal GitHub account. This can be especially helpful if\nyou don't want blog visitors to associate your blog with your personal or\nprofessional projects.\n\n\nCollaboration: If you plan on collaborating with others on your blog,\nhaving a dedicated account makes it easier to manage access and permissions for\nthe blog repository.\n\n\nUltimately, the decision to create a separate GitHub account for your blog\ndepends on your preferences and needs. If you're comfortable with using your\npersonal account and don't see any immediate benefits from creating a new one,\nyou can continue using your existing account.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIf I make a separate GitHub account, should it be an organization account?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCreating an organization account can be a good idea for your blog project,\nespecially if you plan to collaborate with others or manage multiple\nrepositories related to your blog. Here are some advantages of using an\norganization account:\n\n\nTeam management: Organizations in GitHub allow you to manage teams and\ntheir permissions easily. You can create different teams with specific\naccess levels and invite collaborators as needed.\n\n\nRepository management: An organization account can have multiple\nrepositories, which can be helpful if you have related projects for your\nblog, such as themes, plugins, or additional resources.\n\n\nCentralized billing: If you decide to upgrade to a paid plan for your\nblog or other related repositories, organization accounts provide\ncentralized billing for all associated repositories.\n\n\nProfessional appearance: An organization account can give your blog a\nmore professional appearance, as it separates your blog project from your\npersonal GitHub account.\n\n\nHowever, if you're just starting out and don't expect to collaborate with\nothers or manage multiple repositories, using a regular user account may be\nsufficient. You can always create an organization later if your needs change.\nKeep in mind that creating an organization account is free, but some advanced\nfeatures might require a paid plan.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nMultiple repositories might be useful.  I could have a repository online with\nthe code used in a particular blog post for example.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAbsolutely! Using multiple repositories can be an excellent way to organize and\nmanage the code samples and other resources related to your blog posts. By\ncreating separate repositories for each code example or project, you can:\n\n\nImprove organization: Keeping code samples separate from your blog's\nmain repository makes it easier for you and your readers to find and\nnavigate through the code.\n\n\nSimplify collaboration: If you're working with other contributors or\naccepting pull requests, having separate repositories for each code example\ncan make the collaboration process smoother.\n\n\nEnable version control: Using a repository for each code sample allows\nyou to take advantage of Git's version control features, such as branches,\ntags, and commit history, making it easier to manage updates and revisions.\n\n\nFacilitate code reuse: By hosting the code samples in separate\nrepositories, you make it easier for readers to clone, fork, or download the\ncode for their own use and experimentation.\n\n\nTo link the code repositories to your blog posts, you can include a reference\nor hyperlink within the post, directing readers to the corresponding GitHub\nrepository. This way, your readers can easily access, study, and experiment\nwith the code related to the content they're reading.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I went to GitHub to see if I could create an organizational\naccount and name it \"codereflections\" to match the domain name.  Unfortunately,\nsomeone registered it back in 2018, then apparently never used it.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUnfortunately, someone is already squatting on the GitHub username\n\"codereflections\" even though they haven't done anything with it.  The account\nwas created in November 2018 and has had ZERO account activity since then.  Is\nthere any chance GitHub could be convinced to delete that account so I can\ncreate that username, given that it's been reserved for years and never used?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's unlikely that GitHub would delete the inactive account just to free up the\nusername for you. GitHub's username squatting policy typically requires a\ntrademark owner to file a complaint for the release of a username, and even\nthen, it's not guaranteed.\nHowever, you can try contacting GitHub Support to see if they would be willing\nto help in this situation. While it might be a long shot, it's worth a try. You\ncan reach out to GitHub Support via their contact form:\nhttps://support.github.com/contact\nIf GitHub doesn't release the username, you can consider alternative options\nfor the account name. For example, you could use a variation of\n\"codereflections\", such as \"code_reflections\", \"codereflectionsblog\", or\n\"thecodereflections\". This way, you'll still have a name closely related to\nyour domain while working around the username issue.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt appears that the \"code_reflections\" username doesn't exist, so I guess\nthat's a good fallback option.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThat's great! You can go ahead and create a new GitHub account with the\n\"code_reflections\" username as your fallback option. This will still closely\nrelate to your domain name, and your audience should easily recognize it. Once\nyou set up your account, you can start working on your blog using a static site\ngenerator and host it on GitHub Pages. Remember to also set up a custom domain\nfor your GitHub Pages site, so it points to your \"codereflections.com\" domain.\nGood luck with your new blog!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWould GitHub give my request more consideration now that I've registered the\n\"codereflections.com\" domain name?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's possible that owning the \"codereflections.com\" domain name might give your\nrequest more credibility, but it's still up to GitHub's discretion whether they\ndecide to release the inactive account or not. You can try reaching out to\nGitHub support with your request, explaining your situation and providing proof\nthat you own the \"codereflections.com\" domain.\nHowever, keep in mind that there's no guarantee they will release the username,\nas they might have their own policies regarding account management. In case\nthey decide not to release the username, using \"code_reflections\" as a fallback\noption is still a good choice.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI tried opening a support ticket, but they just closed it without a reply, so I\ndecided to create the organization account as \"code-reflections\" instead.  Not\nideal, but oh well.  (I haven't started using that account yet.)\nAfter this, I asked ChatGPT to help with the initial blog post, as I described\nin that post.  Then I investigated\nthemes, since that might decide which blogging platform I wanted to use.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs there a good standard design layout I can use?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there are several standard design layouts that you can use as a starting\npoint for your blog. One popular and effective layout is the F-shaped pattern.\nThis layout takes into account the natural reading pattern of users, where they\ntend to read content in an F-shaped pattern, scanning horizontally across the\ntop, then down the left side and across the middle.\nHere's a basic structure for an F-shaped layout:\n\n\nHeader: Include your blog's logo, navigation menu, and potentially a search\nbar.\n\n\nMain Content Area: This is where your blog posts will appear. Use a clear\nand easy-to-read font with appropriate line spacing. You can choose to display\nyour posts in a single column or a grid format.\n\n\nSidebar: Place the sidebar on the right side of the main content area. Include\nelements such as a brief author bio, a list of recent or popular posts, social\nmedia links, and potentially an email subscription form.\n\n\nFooter: Use this area to display additional navigation links, a copyright\nnotice, and any other relevant information or disclaimers.\n\n\nMake sure to use whitespace effectively to separate different sections and\navoid clutter. You can also incorporate responsive design principles to ensure\nthat your blog looks good on various devices and screen sizes.\nMany static site generators, including Jekyll, come with built-in themes that\nfollow standard design layouts. You can start with one of these themes and then\ncustomize it to match your preferences and branding.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhich static site generators come with the best default themes?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSeveral static site generators come with impressive default themes, providing\nyou with a solid starting point for your blog. Here are a few popular options:\n\n\nJekyll: Jekyll is one of the most popular static site generators and offers\na variety of default themes that are clean, responsive, and easy to customize.\nJekyll's most popular default theme is \"Minima,\" which provides a minimalistic\ndesign and focuses on readability. Jekyll also has a large community, so you\ncan find many other high-quality, free themes created by users.\n\n\nHugo: Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator with a collection of\nbuilt-in themes. Its default theme, \"Ananke,\" is modern and clean, with a\nresponsive design. There are also numerous other themes available in the Hugo\nThemes Showcase that you can use as a starting point for your blog.\n\n\nGatsby: Gatsby is a powerful and flexible static site generator based on\nReact.  While Gatsby doesn't have a default theme per se, it has a rich\necosystem of starter templates, which include themes and pre-configured setups\nto help you get started quickly. Gatsby Starter Blog is a popular choice for\nbloggers, offering a clean and responsive design.\n\n\nEleventy (11ty): Eleventy is a simpler static site generator, offering a\ngreat degree of flexibility. Although it doesn't come with a built-in theme,\nthere are several starter projects available, like \"eleventy-base-blog,\" which\nprovides a clean, responsive, and easy-to-customize design for your blog.\n\n\nEach of these static site generators has its advantages, and the best choice\nwill depend on your specific needs and preferences. Keep in mind that all of\nthese options have active communities, which means you can find additional\nthemes and resources to help you create a blog that meets your requirements.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nLet's suppose that I'll use Jekyll.  What would be the best theme to use that\nwould incorporate Google AdSense and Outbrain well?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen choosing a Jekyll theme that incorporates Google AdSense and Outbrain, you\nshould look for a theme that is clean, responsive, and has dedicated ad spaces\nor is easy to customize for ad placements.

Here are a few more options:\n\nLanyon: Lanyon is a content-first Jekyll theme that focuses on readability\nand simplicity.

When customizing these themes, edit the appropriate template files\n(such as `_includes` or `_layouts`) and insert the ad code where\nyou want the ads to appear.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI also wanted comment support, and I wasn't sure how to do that with a static\nsite generator, so I asked about that too.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat is the best way to integrate comment support?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere are several ways to integrate comment support for your Jekyll blog. Since\nJekyll generates static pages, you'll need to rely on third-party services to\nhandle comments. Here are some popular options:\n\nDisqus: Disqus is a widely-used commenting platform that's easy to integrate\nwith Jekyll. To add Disqus to your Jekyll blog, sign up for a Disqus account,\nand follow their instructions to obtain the universal embed code.

Always make sure to research the latest information and updates\nabout the chosen solution to ensure compatibility and support.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThat's enough for now; tomorrow I'll describe the search for a good hosting\nprovider to run a virtual Linux server of my own, since it appears to be needed\nfor a commenting solution, even if I'm hosting a static site on GitHub Pages...\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/20/how-the-sausage-is-made/","title":"How the sausage is made."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/":{"body":"Yesterday's post didn't finish the\nstory of selecting a blogging platform, because I diverted to a side quest of\nfinding a VPS hosting provider to be able to implement a comment system.  I'll\nfinish the story of the blogging platform in tomorrow's\npost.\n\nI was leaning towards using a static site generator at this point, but I still\nwanted to have a comment system and perhaps other dynamic features, so I\ndecided to look for a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting provider.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf I need a server to self-host these systems, is there any free option\navailable, or will I need to pay a monthly fee for one?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere are some free options available for hosting your self-hosted commenting\nsystem, but they often come with limitations. Here are a few free hosting\nproviders:\n\n\nHeroku (www.heroku.com): Heroku offers a free\ntier, but it comes with limitations, such as limited usage hours and the app\ngoing to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. It might not be ideal for a\nproduction environment, but it's suitable for testing and small projects.\n\n\nGlitch (www.glitch.com): Glitch is another\nplatform where you can host small projects and prototypes for free. It also\nhas limitations on usage and resources, and your app may go to sleep after a\nperiod of inactivity.\n\n\nOracle Cloud (www.oracle.com/cloud/free):\nOracle Cloud offers a free tier with limited resources. You can host small\nprojects on their \"Always Free\" tier, which includes compute and storage\nresources.\n\n\nThese options can work for hosting a self-hosted commenting system, but be\naware of their limitations. As your blog grows and traffic increases, you may\nneed to upgrade to a paid plan or switch to another hosting provider to ensure\nbetter performance, stability, and support.\nRemember that the options mentioned above are subject to change, and it's\nalways a good idea to research the latest offerings and terms of service for\neach provider.\n      \n    \n  \n\nFree options are great, but I wanted more flexibility and fewer limitations, so\nI wanted to explore the paid options as well.  However, I didn't want to drive\nup the cost of this project unnecessarily, just on general principle.  Rather\nthan just choosing one of the most obvious options (such as AWS), I wanted to\nlook for the most affordable reasonable option I could find.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat would be the most cost-efficient paid plans?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCost-efficient paid plans can vary based on your specific requirements, such as\nstorage, bandwidth, and server resources. Here are a few popular and\ncost-efficient hosting providers with their respective entry-level plans:\n\n\nDigitalOcean (www.digitalocean.com):\nDigitalOcean's most affordable plan starts at $5/month, offering 1GB of RAM,\n1 vCPU, 25GB SSD storage, and 1TB of data transfer. They provide scalable\nvirtual private servers (VPS) and a user-friendly control panel.\n\n\nLinode (www.linode.com): Linode's entry-level\nplan starts at $5/month, with 1GB of RAM, 1 vCPU, 25GB SSD storage, and 1TB\nof data transfer. They provide scalable VPS solutions and a simple-to-use\ncontrol panel.\n\n\nVultr (www.vultr.com): Vultr's most affordable\nplan starts at $3.50/month, offering 1GB of RAM, 1 vCPU, 25GB SSD storage,\nand 1TB of data transfer. They offer scalable VPS solutions with an easy-to-use\ninterface.\n\n\nAWS Lightsail\n(aws.amazon.com/lightsail): Amazon\nWeb Services (AWS) Lightsail's most affordable plan starts at $3.50/month,\nproviding 512MB of RAM, 1 vCPU, 20GB SSD storage, and 1TB of data transfer.\nIt's a simplified version of AWS's extensive cloud services.\n\n\nHetzner Cloud (www.hetzner.com/cloud):\nHetzner's entry-level plan starts at €2.49/month (approximately\n$2.75/month), offering 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB SSD storage, and 20TB of data\ntransfer. They provide scalable VPS solutions with competitive pricing.\n\n\nThese are just a few examples of cost-efficient hosting providers. Keep in mind\nthat each provider's features, performance, and customer support can vary. It's\nessential to research and choose the provider that best fits your needs and\nbudget. Be sure to check for any additional costs, such as backup services,\nadditional IP addresses, or data transfer overages.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI was concerned about the possibility of a DDoS attack causing excessive\ntraffic, exceeding bandwidth limits, and causing unlimited additional costs for\nbandwidth overages.  As such, I preferred to find a flat-rate option which\nwouldn't have a risk of bandwidth overage charges.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAre there any which offer unlimited bandwidth for a flat rate?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's difficult to find hosting providers that offer truly unlimited bandwidth\nfor a flat rate. Most providers have fair usage policies or restrictions in\nplace to prevent abuse of resources. However, some hosting providers market\ntheir plans as offering \"unlimited\" bandwidth, although there might still be\nlimitations or restrictions in place. Here are a couple of options you can\nconsider:\n\n\nDreamHost (www.dreamhost.com): DreamHost\noffers shared hosting plans with unlimited bandwidth, starting at\n$2.59/month.  However, shared hosting might not be suitable for self-hosting a\ncommenting system, as the performance may not be as good as a VPS.\nAdditionally, their VPS plans, which start at $10/month, come with unlimited\nbandwidth as well, but they do have a fair usage policy in place.\n\n\nHostinger (www.hostinger.com): Hostinger\noffers shared hosting plans with unlimited bandwidth, starting at\n$1.39/month.  Like DreamHost, shared hosting might not be the best option for\nself-hosting a commenting system. Hostinger's VPS plans start at $3.95/month\nand come with a specific amount of bandwidth, not unlimited.\n\n\nIt's essential to read the provider's terms of service and fair usage policies\nto understand the limitations and restrictions that may apply to \"unlimited\"\nbandwidth. Generally, VPS or cloud hosting providers offer specific data\ntransfer limits based on the plan you choose. If you expect high traffic on\nyour blog, it's better to choose a plan with a higher data transfer limit or\nconsider providers with scalable pricing based on actual usage.\n      \n    \n  \n\nShared hosting plans didn't sound like a great option.  These might offer\n\"unlimited\" bandwidth, but the limitations didn't sound appealing, so I tried\nexplaining more clearly what my goal was.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhich plans have flat rate charges with no extra billing for usage overages,\neven if that means throttling?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhile it's difficult to find hosting providers that guarantee no overage\ncharges with throttling instead, some providers are more lenient with their\npolicies. Here are two providers that are known for their generous resource\nallocations and flat-rate pricing:\n\n\nDreamHost (www.dreamhost.com): DreamHost's\nVPS plans, which start at $10/month, come with unlimited bandwidth, but they\ndo have a fair usage policy in place. While they don't explicitly mention\nthrottling, their policy focuses on preventing abuse of resources. In general,\nDreamHost has a reputation for being lenient with their usage policies, making\nit a good choice for flat-rate pricing.\n\n\nA2 Hosting (www.a2hosting.com): A2 Hosting\noffers VPS plans starting at $5/month, which include unmetered bandwidth.\nThey don't explicitly mention throttling, but their policy is centered around\npreventing abuse and ensuring fair usage of resources. A2 Hosting is known for\nits customer-friendly approach and resource allocations.\n\n\nIt's important to note that the terms and policies may change, and every\nprovider handles usage differently. Always read the provider's terms of service\nand fair usage policies to understand the limitations and restrictions that may\napply. Reach out to their customer support if you need clarification on their\npolicies or have specific requirements.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWhen I looked at the DreamHost website, I saw another option for their\nWordPress hosting plan.  Even though I didn't intend to go with WordPress, I\ndecided to ask ChatGPT for an opinion anyhow.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHmm, DreamHost has a WordPress hosting plan.  Should I be considering that?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDreamHost's WordPress hosting plan can be a good option if you decide to use\nWordPress for your blog. They offer managed WordPress hosting plans that are\noptimized for performance and security. Some benefits of using DreamHost's\nWordPress hosting include:\n\n\nEasy installation: DreamHost makes it easy to install and set up WordPress\nwith their one-click installer.\n\n\nAutomatic updates: DreamHost automatically updates the WordPress core and\nplugins, ensuring that your website is always up to date and secure.\n\n\nEnhanced security: Their managed WordPress hosting includes built-in\nserver-level security measures to protect your site from hacks and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\nFree SSL certificate: DreamHost provides a free SSL certificate to ensure\nthat your site is secure and compliant with modern web standards.\n\n\nDaily backups: DreamHost automatically backs up your site daily, making it\neasy to restore your site in case of data loss or other issues.\n\n\n24/7 support: DreamHost offers round-the-clock support via email and live\nchat to help you with any issues that may arise.\n\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that you don't want to use WordPress due to its\nuse of PHP, you might prefer to stick with a static site generator like Jekyll\nand host it on GitHub Pages or another hosting provider. If you change your\nmind about WordPress, DreamHost's WordPress hosting is a reliable option to\nconsider.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOf course, I wasn't relying on ChatGPT alone here.  During this conversation, I\nwas also using Google and DuckDuckGo to search for good options too.  One of\nthe pages I found was a TechRadar article titled\n\"Unlimited vs. metered vs. unmetered bandwidth hosting\".\nAfter reading this article, I realized that I should be searching for\n\"unmetered\" bandwidth rather than \"unlimited\" bandwidth as the better option.\nWhen I started searching for unmetered options, I found this LowEndBox blog\npost titled \"A 2GB VPS with Unmetered Bandwidth for $1 a\nMonth?!?!?\".\nThis post talked about a cheap VPS with 2GB RAM, KVM, 20GB SSD SATA, unmetered\n100Mbps traffic and DDoS protection for $0.97/month.  Of course, this was only\nan introductory price; after the first 12 months, it would cost $4.20/month,\nwhich still sounded like a decent option.\nI wasn't familiar with this LowEndBox website, but\nthis is their description of the site:\n\nLowEndBox is dedicated to helping people run websites and services on low end\ndedicated servers and cheap virtual private servers, where you only need to\npay a few dollars a month. Our mission is to help people find cheap vps\nhosting.\n\nThis certainly sounds like a good resource to keep in mind for anyone looking\nfor a cheap VPS!\nI also found another great website to help with the search for a good but cheap\nVPS for this project, Server Hunter, which\nlets you search through a huge list of server offers while filtering the offers\nevery way you could imagine: product type (dedicated/hybrid/VPS), pricing,\nprovider, processor, memory, storage, network, software, virtualization type,\nlocation and other features.  This was an excellent resource.\nI searched on Server Hunter for VPS offers with a dedicated IPv4 address and\nunmetered bandwidth, and started researching each one starting with the\ncheapest offer, asking ChatGPT about some of them.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat can you tell me about hostthebest.com?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAs of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I am not familiar with\n\"hostthebest.com\" as a web hosting provider. It is possible that the provider\nhas emerged after that date or it is a less popular provider. When considering\na web hosting provider, it's important to research their reputation, customer\nreviews, pricing plans, performance, and customer support to ensure that they\nwill meet your needs.\nFor well-established and reputable web hosting providers, you can consider\ncompanies like DreamHost, SiteGround, Bluehost, or A2 Hosting, among others.\nThese providers have a proven track record of reliable service, performance,\nand customer support.\n      \n    \n  \n\nChatGPT is not familiar with this provider?  Hmm.  I tried searching the site\non the archive.org Wayback Machine and found 20 years of snapshots, so why\ndoesn't ChatGPT recognize them?  Curious.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \narchive.org shows snapshots of hostthebest.com going back 20 years.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion in my previous response. HostTheBest.com seems to\nbe an established web hosting provider that has been around for quite some\ntime. However, it may not be as popular or widely known as some of the other\nhosting providers I mentioned earlier.\nWhen evaluating HostTheBest.com, it is essential to research their reputation,\ncustomer reviews, pricing plans, performance, and customer support.\nAdditionally, compare their offerings with other hosting providers to make sure\nyou choose the one that best meets your needs.\nYou may also want to consider reaching out to their support team or sales\ndepartment to ask specific questions about their services and gather more\ninformation about the company.\n      \n    \n  \n\nChatGPT seems to apologize a lot sometimes!  At any rate, I continued my\nresearch.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow about \"typical.host\"?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\"Typical.host\" does not appear to be a well-known or popular web hosting\nprovider. A search for the company does not yield any significant results or\ninformation about their reputation, customer reviews, pricing plans, or\nperformance.\nIt is important to choose a reliable and reputable hosting provider to ensure\nthe security, performance, and stability of your website. I recommend\nconsidering the more established and popular hosting providers I previously\nmentioned, such as DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, or DreamHost, among others.\nThese providers have proven track records and are known for their customer\nsupport and reliable services.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHmm, another unpopular choice.  ChatGPT sure does seem eager to steer me back\nto its preferred suggestions!  Does it get kickbacks?!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nskysilk.com?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSkySilk Cloud Services (skysilk.com) is a cloud hosting provider that offers\nVPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting solutions. They have been around for a few\nyears and provide various plans to cater to different needs, including\ndeveloper, small business, and enterprise solutions.\nSkySilk's plans offer a range of resources such as RAM, storage, and CPU cores,\ndepending on your requirements. They also provide features like free DDoS\nprotection, SSD storage, and an easy-to-use management dashboard.\nAlthough SkySilk is not as widely known as some other hosting providers like\nDigitalOcean, Linode, or Vultr, they have received some positive reviews for\ntheir performance and customer support. It could be a viable option for hosting\nyour self-hosted comment system, but it's essential to research their offerings\nand customer feedback to ensure they meet your requirements and expectations.\n      \n    \n  \n\nFrom the searching I did, SkySilk does seem like a reputable provider, but\ntheir prices seem to have increased substantially from what they were said to\nbe offering a few years ago.  Scratch that one, I guess.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \ncloudfanatic.net?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI couldn't find any information about a hosting provider called\n\"cloudfanatic.net.\" It seems like the domain is not associated with a\nwell-known or established web hosting company. I would recommend considering\nreputable hosting providers with proven track records and positive customer\nreviews to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of your hosting\nsolution. Some popular options include DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, AWS, Google\nCloud Platform, and many others, depending on your requirements and\npreferences.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHere we go again.  Yes, I got the message about what the popular options are,\nI'm looking to see if I can find a better option than the popular ones!  This\nparticular one seems to have changed their name.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nLooks like they used to be called \"Servercheap Inc\"\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nServercheap Inc, now known as Cloudfanatic.net, appears to be a smaller web\nhosting provider. While smaller providers can offer competitive pricing and\nmore personalized support, it's essential to thoroughly research their\nperformance, reliability, and customer service before committing.\nWhen evaluating a hosting provider, consider factors such as uptime guarantees,\ncustomer reviews, available features, and the quality of their support team.\nIt's also a good idea to compare their offerings with those of more established\nproviders to ensure you're making an informed decision.\n      \n    \n  \n\nApparently another nobody, moving on...\nAs an aside, I asked about the \"LXC\" logo I had seen listed on many of the\nplans that SkySilk offered.  That didn't ring a bell offhand.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSkySilk plans show an \"LXC\" logo on many plans, what does that mean?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nLXC stands for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtualization technology that\nallows multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) to run on a single host.\nLXC containers share the same kernel as the host system, which makes them more\nresource-efficient and faster than traditional virtual machines (VMs) that\nrequire a separate kernel for each instance.\nWhen a hosting plan shows an \"LXC\" logo, it means that the provider is using\nLinux Containers for virtualization. This can offer better performance and\nresource management for your hosted applications and services, as LXC\ncontainers have lower overhead compared to traditional VMs. However, keep in\nmind that LXC containers are less isolated from the host system, which could\npotentially result in a slightly lower security level compared to full\nvirtualization.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOh, right.  I understand about Linux containers, having used Docker containers\nbefore.  I was pretty sure an LXC container would have root access, but it\nwouldn't hurt to confirm it.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWould the LXC container have root access?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, LXC containers typically provide root access to the container's\nenvironment. This allows you to have full control over the software and\nconfiguration within the container, as if it were a standalone system. However,\nthis root access is limited to the container itself and does not grant you root\naccess to the host system or other containers running on the same host.\nIt's essential to be cautious when using root access, as it allows you to\nperform actions that could potentially harm the container or its data. Always\nmake sure to understand the implications of the commands you run as root and\nfollow best practices for system administration and security.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThen it occurred to me...  I want to be able to run Docker containers on my\nserver!  I doubted that would be possible here.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs it possible to run Docker containers within?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nRunning Docker containers inside LXC containers is generally not recommended,\nas it can lead to compatibility issues and potential security risks. Both LXC\nand Docker use similar underlying technologies (like cgroups and namespaces),\nand nesting these containerization methods can create conflicts.\nIn some cases, it might be technically possible to run Docker inside an LXC\ncontainer, but it would require significant configuration adjustments and\npotentially decrease the isolation and security benefits of using containers in\nthe first place.\nIf you need to use both LXC and Docker containers, it's better to run them\nseparately on the same host or use a container orchestration platform like\nKubernetes to manage them. This approach allows you to maintain proper\nisolation and take advantage of the respective benefits of each\ncontainerization method.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, LXC container plans are out.  Meanwhile, I'm also checking into ChatGPT's\nfavored options too.  When I checked the linode.com\nwebsite, I discovered that Linode was acquired by Akamai in early 2022.  Since\nthat option appeared to be confusing and in flux, I decided to skip it.  How\nabout DigitalOcean?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt appears Linode was acquired by Akamai.  Tell me more about DigitalOcean.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDigitalOcean is a popular cloud infrastructure provider founded in 2011 by Ben\nUretsky, Moisey Uretsky, Mitch Wainer, Alec Hartman, and Jeff Carr. The company\nfocuses on providing simple, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions for\ndevelopers, startups, and small-to-medium-sized businesses.\nDigitalOcean's primary offerings include:\n\n\nDroplets: These are scalable virtual private servers (VPS) that can be\nquickly deployed and customized to match various computing needs. Droplets\ncan be created with different configurations of CPU, RAM, and storage to suit\nspecific use cases and performance requirements.\n\n\nKubernetes: DigitalOcean offers a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies\ncontainer orchestration and deployment. This service helps developers manage\nand scale containerized applications easily.\n\n\nApp Platform: A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that simplifies\napplication deployment, management, and scaling. It supports several popular\nprogramming languages and frameworks, including Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby,\nand more.\n\n\nBlock Storage: Scalable, high-performance SSD-based storage that can be\nattached to Droplets to expand storage capacity.\n\n\nObject Storage: DigitalOcean Spaces is an S3-compatible object storage\nservice, suitable for storing and serving large amounts of unstructured data\nlike images, videos, and backups.\n\n\nDatabases: Managed databases for popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL,\nand Redis, which can be quickly deployed and scaled as needed.\n\n\nNetworking: Various networking solutions, including Virtual Private Cloud\n(VPC), floating IPs, load balancers, and Cloud Firewalls, to enhance\nconnectivity and security.\n\n\nMarketplace: A collection of pre-configured applications and development\nstacks that can be quickly deployed on DigitalOcean infrastructure.\n\n\nDigitalOcean is known for its simplicity, user-friendly interface, extensive\ndocumentation, and active community. The company offers a pay-as-you-go pricing\nmodel, with competitive rates compared to other cloud providers. DigitalOcean\nhas data centers across the globe, ensuring low-latency access and redundancy\nfor its customers.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, sounds like a decent provider indeed.  But what about the bandwidth?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDoes DigitalOcean have unmetered plans?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDigitalOcean does not offer unmetered plans. They charge for bandwidth usage on\na pay-as-you-go basis, meaning you'll be billed for the data transfer used by\nyour Droplets (virtual private servers) and other services. However, their\npricing model is competitive, and they offer a generous amount of free\nbandwidth with each Droplet.\nFor example, at the time of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the most\nbasic Droplet plan included 1 TB of free outbound data transfer per month. If\nyour usage exceeds the free transfer limit, you will be charged for additional\ndata transfer at a specific rate per gigabyte (which may vary by region).\nIt's important to note that inbound data transfer to your Droplets is free and\ndoes not count towards your bandwidth usage. Also, data transfer between\nDroplets within the same data center is free and not counted towards the limit.\nYou can monitor your bandwidth usage through the DigitalOcean control panel,\nand it's a good idea to keep an eye on it to avoid unexpected costs if your\nusage increases beyond the included free transfer amount.\n      \n    \n  \n\nPay-as-you-go bandwidth?  No thanks.  That's what I'm trying to avoid!\nOkay, time to try a different approach...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat are the best cheap plans from reputable hosting providers with unmetered\nbandwidth?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFinding the perfect balance between price, reputation, and unmetered bandwidth\ncan be challenging. Here are some hosting providers that offer relatively\ninexpensive plans with unmetered bandwidth. Keep in mind that the specifics of\nthese plans may change over time, so it's always a good idea to check the\nprovider's website for the most up-to-date information:\n\nA2 Hosting: They offer shared hosting plans with unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"Lite\" plan is their most affordable option, which includes a\nsingle website, free SSL, and cPanel control panel.\nHostGator: Their shared hosting plans come with unmetered\nbandwidth. The \"Hatchling\" plan is their cheapest option, allowing for a single\ndomain, free SSL certificate, and a user-friendly control panel.\nDreamHost:  DreamHost provides shared hosting plans with unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"Shared Starter\" plan allows you to host one website with a\nfree domain, SSL certificate, and the use of their custom control panel.\nBluehost: Bluehost's shared hosting plans also include unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"Basic\" plan is the most affordable and supports one website,\na free domain, free SSL, and a user-friendly control panel.\nSiteGround: SiteGround offers shared hosting plans with unmetered\nbandwidth. Their \"StartUp\" plan allows you to host one website, with a free\nSSL, daily backups, and a custom control panel.\n\nRemember that \"unmetered\" bandwidth does not necessarily mean \"unlimited.\"\nProviders may impose certain restrictions or fair usage policies to ensure that\ntheir services are not abused. It's essential to review the terms and\nconditions before choosing a hosting provider to ensure you understand the\nlimitations and guidelines.\n      \n    \n  \n\nShared hosting plans again?  That doesn't sound Docker-friendly!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDo any of these offer a dedicated VPS with root access that can run Docker\ncontainers on it?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, several of the mentioned hosting providers offer VPS hosting with root\naccess, allowing you to run Docker containers. Here are some details about the\nVPS offerings of these providers:\n\nA2 Hosting: They offer VPS hosting plans that come with root access\nand the ability to install Docker. Their unmanaged VPS plans are the most\naffordable option for developers comfortable with managing their server.\nHostGator: HostGator provides VPS hosting with full root access.\nTheir \"Snappy 2000\" plan is the entry-level VPS plan that allows you to install\nDocker and manage the server as needed.\nDreamHost: DreamHost offers VPS hosting plans with root access,\nallowing you to run Docker containers. Their \"Basic VPS\" plan provides a\nmanaged environment, while the \"Unmanaged VPS\" option is more suitable for\ndevelopers who prefer complete control over the server.\nBluehost: Bluehost's VPS hosting plans also include root access.\nTheir \"Standard\" plan is the most affordable option, providing you with the\nability to install Docker and manage your server.\nSiteGround: SiteGround no longer offers traditional VPS hosting\nplans. They have shifted their focus to cloud hosting, which also provides root\naccess and the ability to run Docker containers. However, their cloud hosting\nplans are generally more expensive than their shared hosting plans.\n\nAll of these providers have different plan options, pricing, and features. It's\nessential to review their offerings and determine which provider and plan best\nsuit your needs and budget.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSince Server Hunter can search by virtualization type, I decided to narrow the\nsearch based on which types could run Docker containers.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhich of these virtualization types would allow the virtual server to run\nDocker containers without difficulty? Hyper-V KVM LXC\nOpenVZ Other Xen VMware\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe virtualization types that allow you to run Docker containers without\ndifficulty are:\n\n\nKVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine): KVM is a full virtualization solution\nthat provides each virtual server with dedicated resources and complete\nisolation from other virtual machines. It allows you to run Docker containers\nwithout any issues.\n\n\nXen: Xen is another full virtualization solution that provides dedicated\nresources and isolation for virtual machines. You can run Docker containers\non Xen-based virtual servers without any problems.\n\n\nVMware: VMware is a popular virtualization platform that also allows you to\nrun Docker containers without any issues. It provides full virtualization\nand resource isolation for virtual machines.\n\n\nHyper-V: Hyper-V is a virtualization technology developed by Microsoft. It\nis a full virtualization solution that enables you to run Docker containers\nwithout any difficulties.\n\n\nLXC and OpenVZ are container-based virtualization technologies, which means\nthey share the host kernel and might have limitations when it comes to running\nDocker containers. While it is technically possible to run Docker within LXC or\nOpenVZ, it's generally not recommended due to potential compatibility and\nsecurity concerns.\nFor the best experience when running Docker containers, it is recommended to\nuse a full virtualization solution like KVM, Xen, VMware, or Hyper-V.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, it occurred to me to ask about the Server Hunter website,\nalthough it did seem legit to me.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow reputable is serverhunter.com?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nServerHunter.com is a web hosting comparison platform that helps users find and\ncompare various hosting providers and their plans. It gathers information from\nnumerous hosting providers and presents it in a user-friendly way, making it\neasier for users to make informed decisions when choosing a hosting service.\nWhile ServerHunter.com does provide a valuable service, it's essential to keep\nin mind that it is a comparison platform and not a hosting provider itself. It\nis always a good idea to research individual hosting providers and read reviews\nfrom trusted sources before making a final decision.\nAs a comparison platform, ServerHunter.com seems to have a positive reputation\nand has been mentioned in several online articles and forums related to web\nhosting. However, it's still essential to do your own research and use multiple\nsources when evaluating hosting providers and their plans.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre there similar server comparison sites?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there are several other server comparison sites that can help you find the\nbest hosting provider and plan for your needs. Some of these include:\n\n\nWebHostingGeeks.com: Web Hosting Geeks is a\nweb hosting review and comparison site that offers information on various\nhosting providers, their plans, and features. It also includes user reviews to\nhelp you make an informed decision.\n\n\nHostingAdvice.com: HostingAdvice.com provides\ncomprehensive reviews, comparisons, and guides for a wide range of hosting\nproviders and services. The site covers shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated\nservers, and more.\n\n\nHostAdvice.com: HostAdvice.com is another web\nhosting comparison site that offers detailed reviews, comparisons, and\nguides on hosting providers and their plans. It also features user reviews to\nhelp you make an informed decision.\n\n\nWebHostingTalk.com: WebHostingTalk is a\npopular online forum where users can discuss and share information about web\nhosting services, providers, and related topics. While not a direct comparison\nsite, it can be a valuable resource for finding information and opinions on\nvarious hosting providers and plans.\n\n\nWhoIsHostingThis.com: WhoIsHostingThis.com\nis a web hosting comparison site that offers detailed reviews and\ncomparisons of various hosting providers and plans. It also includes\nuser-generated reviews and a tool to help you determine which hosting provider\nis hosting a specific website.\n\n\nThese are just a few examples of server comparison sites available online.\nRemember to do thorough research and read multiple reviews before choosing a\nhosting provider and plan.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I found an offer from BuyVM that looked really good, so I asked\nChatGPT about this hosting provider.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat do you know about BuyVM/frantech.ca?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBuyVM, a part of the FranTech Solutions group, is a web hosting provider known\nfor its affordable and reliable hosting services. They offer a range of hosting\nsolutions, including Virtual Private Servers (VPS), dedicated servers, and\nshared hosting. Here are some key points about BuyVM and FranTech Solutions:\n\n\nFounded in 2010: FranTech Solutions, the parent company of BuyVM, has been\nin the hosting industry for over a decade, which indicates a level of\nstability and experience in the market.\n\n\nAffordable hosting options: BuyVM is known for its budget-friendly VPS\nhosting plans, which cater to different needs and requirements. They offer\nvarious packages with different resource allocations, making it easy for\ncustomers to choose a plan that suits their specific needs.\n\n\nKVM virtualization: BuyVM uses KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)\nvirtualization technology for its VPS hosting. KVM provides better isolation\nand performance compared to some other virtualization technologies, allowing\nfor a more stable hosting environment.\n\n\nSLA-backed uptime: BuyVM offers a 99.9% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA)\nfor their hosting services, ensuring that customers can expect reliable\nservice and minimal downtime.\n\n\nData center locations: BuyVM has multiple data center locations in the\nUnited States and Europe, allowing customers to choose a location that best\nsuits their target audience for better performance and latency.\n\n\nCustom control panel: BuyVM offers a custom-built control panel called\nStallion, which provides users with an easy-to-use interface to manage their\nhosting services.\n\n\nCustomer support: BuyVM provides customer support through email and a ticket\nsystem.

As with any hosting provider, it's\nessential to research and read user reviews to get a better understanding of\ntheir service quality and customer support.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWe have a winner!  Affordable prices on good plans with full KVM virtualization\nfrom a well-established, reputable provider?  Great!  The SLA, data center\noptions and Stallion control panels are all extra bonuses that I wasn't even\nfactoring into my search.  Sure, it would be nice to have live support, but\nthat would drive up their costs and prices.  It seems like a fair tradeoff.\nI also did some Google searches about the provider.  The results looked good,\nand their customers seem to like them.  Paraphrasing here, I recall seeing a\npost from someone saying that BuyVM focuses on providing good service at\naffordable prices and that they rely on word-of-mouth instead of advertising.\nSounds good to me, I'll give it a try.\nThe base cost of the plan I chose was only $3.50/month, but that was with no\nbackups.  Adding daily backups was only $0.50/month more, so that was a\nno-brainer.  They also offer DDoS protection, but that would cost another\n$3.00/month.  Since that was nearly the cost of the server itself, it didn't\nseem worth including at this time.\nThe odds of my blog being targeted for a DDoS attack seem infinitesimal for the\nforeseeable future, and I don't see much reason to fret over the possibility of\nbeing down for hours, or even days.  After all, this is a brand-new blog, so\nthere's no audience yet.  If it somehow becomes popular someday, I can always\nadd the DDoS protection later.  ChatGPT agreed.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSome providers claim to have free DDOS protection.  BuyVM charges an extra\n$3.00/month to add DDOS protection.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection is an important feature for web\nhosting providers to offer their customers, as it helps prevent malicious\ntraffic from overwhelming a website or server, leading to downtime and\nperformance issues. Different hosting providers handle DDoS protection in\nvarious ways, and some may offer it as a free service, while others charge\nextra for it.\nWhen a provider offers free DDoS protection, it's usually a basic level of\nprotection that may only be effective against small-scale attacks or the most\ncommon types of attacks. This basic level of protection might be sufficient for\nsome users, but it may not be enough to mitigate more sophisticated or\nlarger-scale attacks.\nBuyVM charges an additional $3.00/month for their DDoS protection, which may\nindicate that they offer a more robust or advanced level of protection compared\nto some of the free options available from other providers. By charging for\nthis service, they might also be able to allocate more resources to their DDoS\nprotection infrastructure, leading to better performance and protection for\ntheir customers.\nWhen choosing a hosting provider, it's essential to consider the type of DDoS\nprotection offered and whether the protection level is adequate for your needs.\nIf your website or application is particularly susceptible to DDoS attacks or\nrequires a high level of protection, it might be worth paying extra for a more\ncomprehensive DDoS protection service.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nTheir additional charge for DDoS protection includes an additional IP address.\nWhy would that be?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen a hosting provider offers DDoS protection with an additional IP address,\nit's typically because the DDoS protection service operates on a separate IP\naddress from your main hosting IP address. This setup provides several\nbenefits:\n\n\nIsolation: By using a separate IP address for DDoS protection, the provider\ncan isolate the traffic destined for your server. The DDoS protection\nservice will filter the incoming traffic on this separate IP address, allowing\nonly legitimate traffic to reach your server. This setup helps maintain the\nstability and performance of your main hosting IP address.\n\n\nRedundancy: Having an additional IP address allows you to switch between the\nprotected IP and your main IP if needed. For instance, if a DDoS attack\ntargets your primary IP address, you can switch to the protected IP address to\nmaintain your website's availability.\n\n\nFlexibility: An additional IP address provides flexibility in managing your\nnetwork resources. You can choose to route specific services or applications\nthrough the protected IP address while keeping other services on the main IP\naddress. This can be useful if you only need DDoS protection for specific parts\nof your infrastructure.\n\n\nEasier management: By separating the DDoS-protected traffic from your\nregular traffic, it's easier to monitor and manage your network resources.\nYou can more accurately measure the effectiveness of the DDoS protection\nservice and make adjustments as needed.\n\n\nIn summary, an additional IP address for DDoS protection helps to isolate and\nmanage traffic more effectively, providing increased flexibility and redundancy\nto ensure your website or application remains available during an attack.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould I worry about DDoS protection at all?  This is just a blog website.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFor a personal blog or a small website, DDoS protection might not be a high\npriority, especially if you're just starting out. DDoS attacks are more\ncommonly targeted at larger businesses, high-profile websites, and those with\ncontroversial content. However, it's essential to be aware that DDoS attacks\ncan happen to anyone, and having some level of protection can be beneficial.\nHere are a few factors to consider when deciding whether to invest in DDoS\nprotection for your blog:\n\n\nTraffic and audience size: If you have a small audience and low traffic, the\nlikelihood of being targeted by a DDoS attack is relatively low. However, as\nyour blog grows and gains more visibility, the risk may increase.\n\n\nNature of your content: If your blog covers controversial topics or attracts\nstrong opinions, there may be a higher likelihood of being targeted by a\nDDoS attack.\n\n\nBudget: DDoS protection services can be an additional expense, and you'll\nneed to weigh the cost against the potential benefits for your blog.\n\n\nHosting provider features: Some hosting providers include basic DDoS\nprotection as part of their standard offerings. If your hosting provider\noffers such protection, you may not need to invest in additional services.\n\n\nIn summary, DDoS protection might not be a high priority for a small blog, but\nit's essential to be aware of the risks and consider the factors above. As your\nblog grows and gains more visibility, you may want to revisit this decision and\nconsider implementing a DDoS protection solution.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I start without DDoS protection and add it after the fact if I get\ntargeted?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can start without DDoS protection and add it later if you get targeted\nor feel the need for increased security. Many hosting providers and third-party\nservices offer DDoS protection that can be added to your existing hosting plan\nwithout requiring any significant changes to your website.\nHowever, it's essential to keep in mind that adding DDoS protection after an\nattack has already started may not be as effective as having it in place\nbeforehand. The time it takes to set up the protection and mitigate the attack\ncould result in prolonged downtime or loss of service for your website.\nIf you're concerned about the potential for DDoS attacks but don't want to\ninvest in protection services upfront, consider choosing a hosting provider\nthat includes basic DDoS protection in their standard hosting plans. This way,\nyou'll have some level of protection from the start without incurring\nadditional costs. As your website grows and the risk of DDoS attacks increases,\nyou can then evaluate whether you need more advanced protection services.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI ordered the VPS server from BuyVM and mentioned some details to ChatGPT.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI'm going to try this KVM VPS from BuyVM/frantech.ca -- which operating system\nwould be best?  CentOS, Debian or Ubuntu?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe choice between CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu depends on your personal\npreferences, familiarity with the operating systems, and the specific\nrequirements of your project. All three are popular and reliable Linux\ndistributions, but they have some differences that may influence your decision:\n\n\nCentOS: CentOS is based on the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)\nand is known for its stability and long-term support. It's often chosen for\nproduction environments, especially when running enterprise applications. If\nyou're looking for a stable OS with a strong focus on security and reliability,\nCentOS is a good choice. However, CentOS tends to have older packages compared\nto Debian and Ubuntu due to its focus on stability.\n\n\nDebian: Debian is known for its robustness and stability, and it's the basis\nfor many other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. It has a vast\nrepository of packages and a strong focus on free software. If you value\nstability and a broad selection of packages, Debian is an excellent choice.\nDebian generally strikes a balance between being up-to-date and stable.\n\n\nUbuntu: Ubuntu is based on Debian and is one of the most popular Linux\ndistributions. It's known for its ease of use, regular updates, and strong\ncommunity support. Ubuntu has a more frequent release cycle compared to CentOS\nand Debian, meaning you'll get newer packages and software more quickly. If you\nprefer a more user-friendly experience and the latest software, Ubuntu is a\ngreat option.\n\n\nIn summary, if you prioritize stability and long-term support, CentOS is a good\nchoice. For a balance between stability and up-to-date packages, Debian is a\nsolid option. If you want a user-friendly experience and the latest software,\ngo with Ubuntu.\nAs a side note, CentOS has shifted its focus to CentOS Stream, a\nrolling-release distribution that serves as an upstream for RHEL. This change\nhas led many users to consider alternatives like Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux,\nwhich aim to provide the same stability and long-term support as the original\nCentOS.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI'll go with Ubuntu.  That's what I use with WSL on my laptop too.  It has a\npart of the configuration page under a section header of \"Configure Server\" and\na label of \"Service Name\" on the input box, which was prepopulated with a value\nof \"SLICE-183963\".  Any idea what this is?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe \"Service Name\" field is likely used by BuyVM/frantech.ca to internally\nidentify and manage your VPS instance. This prepopulated value \"SLICE-183963\"\nis probably an automatically generated name assigned to your new VPS.\nIn most cases, you don't need to worry about this field, and you can keep the\ndefault value. However, you might want to change it to something more\ndescriptive and meaningful to you, especially if you plan to manage multiple\nVPS instances. This can make it easier to identify and manage your VPS\ninstances from the provider's control panel. For example, you could use\nsomething like \"CodeReflectionsBlog\" as the service name to make it more\nrecognizable.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI can probably change this name later?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you should be able to change the \"Service Name\" later through the hosting\nprovider's control panel or customer dashboard. Generally, hosting providers\nallow you to update and manage various aspects of your VPS, including its name,\nfor easier management.\nIf you have any trouble changing the name later or if you're unsure how to do\nit, you can always reach out to the hosting provider's support team for\nassistance.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHere's the details on the VPS plan I ordered:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOkay, I've placed the order for the VPS from BuyVM/frantech.ca.  The product\nname is \"Las Vegas - AMD RYZEN KVM - LV RYZEN KVM 1GB\" and the specs are: 1 GB\nDDR4 RAM, 1 CPU Core @ 3.9 GHz+, 20 GB NVME Storage, 1 IPv4 + /48 IPv6,\n1000Mbit Unmetered BW, DDoS Protection Available, BGP Session Available.  The\nbase price is $3.50 USD per month, and I added the automatic daily backups for\nanother $0.50 USD per month, so the total is $4.00 USD per month.  I didn't\nsign up for the DDoS protection at this time; that would be another $3.00 USD\nper month.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCongratulations on setting up your VPS with BuyVM/frantech.ca! You've chosen a\nVPS plan with a good balance of resources for a personal blog, and the\nadditional daily backups will provide you with peace of mind in case of data\nloss.\nNow that you have your VPS, you can proceed with setting up your preferred\nstatic site generator, comment system, and other necessary tools and services\nfor your blog. If you face any issues or have questions during the setup\nprocess, feel free to ask for assistance.\nGood luck with your new blog, and I hope it becomes a successful platform for\nsharing your programming insights and experiences!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSince this is a KVM VPS, I should be able to easily run any number of Docker\ncontainers, right?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can run multiple Docker containers on your KVM VPS without any issues.\nKVM virtualization provides full virtualization, which means you have an\nisolated environment with its own kernel, allowing you to run Docker and create\ncontainers without restrictions. Just make sure to monitor your resource usage\n(CPU, RAM, and storage) as you add more containers to ensure that your VPS\ncontinues to perform well and doesn't become overloaded.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThus concludes my quest for a server to use for a comment system and whatever\nother purposes come to mind.  Tomorrow, I'll return to the topic of choosing\nthe blogging platform.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/","title":"Searching for a hosting provider..."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/":{"body":"After my initial exploration of blogging\nplatforms and finding a VPS hosting\nprovider, I needed to decide\nwhich blogging platform to use.  ChatGPT continued to assist with the\ndecision-making process.\n\nEarlier in the conversation, ChatGPT mentioned Zola and that it offers Sass\ncompilation out of the box.  I didn't recognize that offhand, so I asked.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou said that Zola offers Sass compilation out of the box. What is Sass\ncompilation?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSass (short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting\nlanguage that extends CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Sass allows developers to\nuse variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making it easier to write\nand maintain complex CSS code. Sass code needs to be compiled into standard CSS\nbefore it can be used by web browsers.\nSass compilation refers to the process of converting Sass code into CSS. This\nis typically done using a build tool or task runner, such as Gulp, Grunt, or\nWebpack. However, some static site generators, like Zola, offer built-in Sass\ncompilation, meaning you don't need to set up a separate build tool or process\nfor it. This can make it more convenient to work with Sass when building a\nwebsite or a blog, as the compilation step is handled automatically by the\nstatic site generator.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould I bother using Sass?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing Sass can be beneficial for your project depending on your requirements\nand familiarity with CSS. Here are some reasons to consider using Sass:\n\n\nMaintainability: Sass allows you to use variables, which can make it easier\nto manage and maintain your stylesheets. For example, you can define colors,\nfont sizes, and other frequently used properties as variables and reuse them\nthroughout your styles.\n\n\nModularization: You can split your Sass code into multiple files and use the\n`@import` directive to include them in the main stylesheet. This can help you\norganize your code better and promote modular design.\n\n\nNested syntax: Sass enables you to nest selectors within one another, which\ncan make your code more readable and easier to maintain by closely mimicking\nthe structure of your HTML.\n\n\nMixins and functions: Sass provides mixins and functions that allow you to\nreuse blocks of code and perform calculations. This can help you write more\nefficient and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.\n\n\nExtensibility: Sass provides advanced features like loops and conditional\nstatements that can help you create complex styles with minimal code.\n\n\nHowever, if your project is small, or you're not familiar with Sass, it may be\nan unnecessary addition. For simple projects, plain CSS might be sufficient.\nAdditionally, learning Sass syntax and setting up the compilation process can\nadd extra complexity to your project.\nIn summary, Sass can be beneficial for larger projects or when you want to\nimprove the maintainability and organization of your styles. However, for\nsmaller projects or when you're less experienced with CSS, sticking to plain\nCSS might be more appropriate.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, sounds useful.  I'll have to keep that in mind.  Meanwhile, I wanted to\ncompare the options ChatGPT previously suggested.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow do Jekyll, Zola and Cobalt compare with each other?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nJekyll, Zola, and Cobalt are all static site generators, but they have some\ndifferences in terms of features, performance, and the languages they are built\non. Here's a comparison of the three:\n\nLanguage and Performance:\n\nJekyll is written in Ruby and uses the Liquid templating engine. It is one\nof the most popular static site generators and has a large community and\necosystem. However, it can be slower in comparison to Zola and Cobalt,\nespecially for larger sites.\nZola is written in Rust and uses the Tera templating engine. Rust is known\nfor its performance, and as a result, Zola can build sites much faster than\nJekyll. This can be a significant advantage for larger projects.\nCobalt is also written in Rust and uses the Liquid templating engine. It\noffers good performance due to Rust but may not be as fast as Zola due to\ndifferences in the templating engine.\n\nFeatures:\n\nJekyll offers a wide range of features, including support for Sass\ncompilation, syntax highlighting, and built-in support for blogging with\npagination. It also has a vast library of plugins and themes, thanks to its\nlarge community.\nZola has a similar feature set to Jekyll but with a focus on performance.\nIt offers built-in support for Sass compilation, syntax highlighting,\ntaxonomies, and pagination. It also has shortcodes and templates for common\ntasks.\nCobalt provides a more minimalistic set of features compared to Jekyll and\nZola. It does not have built-in support for Sass compilation or syntax\nhighlighting but supports blogging and pagination.\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem:\n\nJekyll has the largest community and ecosystem among the three, with a vast\nlibrary of plugins, themes, and resources. It's been around the longest and has\nstrong support from its community.\nZola is gaining popularity but has a smaller community and ecosystem\ncompared to Jekyll. There are fewer themes and plugins available, but the\ncommunity is growing.\nCobalt has the smallest community and ecosystem among the three. It has\nlimited themes and plugins, which might be a drawback if you're looking for\nextensive customization options.\n\nIn summary, Jekyll is a popular choice with a large community and ecosystem,\nbut it may be slower for larger projects. Zola offers better performance and a\nsimilar feature set but has a smaller community. Cobalt is a more minimalistic\noption with fewer features and a smaller community. Choosing between them\nlargely depends on your project requirements, preferred language, and the level\nof community support and customization options you need.\n      \n    \n  \n\nJekyll does sound like a very nice option, but Rust is one of the two languages\nthat I'm most interested in, so I wanted to give one of those options a try.  I\nwasn't familiar with the Liquid templating engine, nor with the Tera templating\nengine.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI don't know anything about the Liquid templating engine.  Tell me about it.\nHow does it compare with Tera?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nLiquid and Tera are both templating engines used to generate HTML content for\nstatic site generators. Here's a comparison between the two:\n\nLiquid:\n\nLiquid is a Ruby-based templating language developed by Shopify. It is used\nin various projects, including Jekyll and Cobalt.\nIt is designed to be simple and easy to learn, with a focus on safety and\nsecurity.\nIt uses a combination of tags, filters, and objects to process and render\ntemplates.\nTags are used for logic and control structures, such as loops and\nconditionals. Filters are used to modify the output of an object, and objects\nrepresent the content being output.\nLiquid is considered safe because it does not allow arbitrary code\nexecution, which can help prevent security vulnerabilities.\nIt has a wide range of plugins and a large community, making it easier to\nfind resources and support.\n\nTera:\n\nTera is a Rust-based templating language inspired by Jinja2 and the Django\ntemplate language. It is used in Zola.\nIt is designed for performance and safety, leveraging the speed of Rust.\nTera uses similar concepts to Liquid, such as tags, filters, and objects,\nto process and render templates.\nIt also supports template inheritance, which allows you to create a base\ntemplate and extend it with child templates. This can help you create more\nmaintainable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.\nLike Liquid, Tera is considered safe because it does not allow arbitrary\ncode execution.\n\n\nComparison:\n\nBoth Liquid and Tera are designed for safety and simplicity, and both use\nsimilar concepts like tags, filters, and objects.\nLiquid has a larger community and a wider range of plugins, thanks to its\nuse in Jekyll and Shopify.\nTera is focused on performance and is written in Rust, which can make it\nfaster in some cases.\nTera supports template inheritance, which can help create more maintainable\nand DRY code.\n\nChoosing between Liquid and Tera depends on the static site generator you\nprefer and the language you are more comfortable with. If you're using Jekyll\nor Cobalt, you'll work with Liquid, whereas if you choose Zola, you'll use\nTera. Both are powerful and safe templating engines that can help you build\nstatic websites efficiently.\n      \n    \n  \n\nTera is implemented in Rust, focused on performance and supports template\ninheritance.  Sounds good to me!  I don't see much reason to use Cobalt, since\nit has the smallest community and ecosystem, and a minimalistic feature set.\nZola seems like the best choice for me, and it has a similar feature set to\nJekyll, but Jekyll is more popular with a larger community and ecosystem.  If I\npick Zola over Jekyll, will I regret it?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWill I lose any important features or functionality if I choose Zola over\nJekyll?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhile both Jekyll and Zola are powerful and feature-rich static site\ngenerators, there are some differences in functionality that you should be\naware of when choosing between the two:\n\nLanguage and ecosystem:\n\nJekyll is written in Ruby and has a large plugin ecosystem, which means you\ncan easily extend its functionality using various plugins developed by the\ncommunity.\nZola is written in Rust, which is known for its speed and safety. However,\nit doesn't have as large of a plugin ecosystem as Jekyll. This means that there\nmight be fewer ready-made solutions for specific use cases, and you may need to\nimplement certain functionality on your own.\n\nTheme availability:\n\nJekyll has a larger community, which has resulted in a greater number of\nthemes available for use. This can make it easier to find a suitable theme for\nyour blog.\nZola has fewer themes available, which means you might need to create your\nown theme or modify an existing one to fit your needs.\n\nHosting options:\n\nJekyll has native support for GitHub Pages, which makes it easy to deploy\nand host your site for free on GitHub.\nZola does not have native support for GitHub Pages, but you can still use\nit with GitHub Pages by generating the static files and pushing them to your\nrepository. This requires an additional step, but it is not overly complicated.\n\nLearning curve:\n\nJekyll uses the Liquid templating language, which might be easier to learn\nfor some users, especially if they have experience with Ruby or other template\nlanguages like Jinja2.\nZola uses the Tera templating language, which is inspired by Jinja2 and\nDjango. While it is still relatively easy to learn, some users might prefer the\nfamiliarity of Liquid.\n\n\nOverall, while Zola may lack some of the extensive plugin ecosystem and theme\navailability of Jekyll, it still offers a powerful and fast static site\ngenerator with a focus on simplicity and performance. If you're comfortable\nwith Rust and don't mind a smaller community and fewer ready-made solutions,\nZola can be an excellent choice. However, if you prefer a larger community, a\nwider range of plugins and themes, and native support for GitHub Pages, Jekyll\nmight be the better option.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre there any Jekyll plugins particularly of special interest that don't have\nequivalents available for Zola?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhile Zola does have built-in features that cover many use cases, there might\nbe some Jekyll plugins with unique functionality that don't have direct\nequivalents in Zola. Some examples include:\n\n\njekyll-admin: This plugin provides a user interface to manage your Jekyll\nsite, including editing content, managing drafts, and previewing changes.\nThere is no direct equivalent for Zola, and you'll need to rely on your text\neditor or other content management tools.\n\n\njekyll-archives: This plugin automatically generates archive pages for your\nJekyll site, such as monthly or yearly archives, tag archives, or category\narchives. Zola has support for taxonomies (tags and categories) out-of-the-box,\nbut it doesn't have built-in support for generating date-based archives.\n\n\njekyll-paginate: This plugin provides pagination functionality for your\nJekyll site. Zola has built-in support for pagination, but the\nimplementation and customization options might differ from those offered by the\njekyll-paginate plugin.\n\n\njekyll-redirect-from: This plugin allows you to easily create redirect pages\nfor changed or moved content. In Zola, you'll need to handle redirects\nmanually, either by creating a custom short code or configuring redirects on\nyour web server.\n\n\njekyll-assets: This plugin helps with asset management, such as CSS,\nJavaScript, and image files. It provides features like asset fingerprinting,\ncompression, and caching. Zola has some built-in features for asset management,\nlike Sass compilation, but it doesn't provide the same level of functionality\nas jekyll-assets.\n\n\nWhile these plugins might not have direct equivalents in Zola, there are often\nalternative solutions or workarounds for achieving similar functionality. If a\nspecific Jekyll plugin is crucial to your project, consider whether the\nfeatures it provides can be replicated in Zola or if sticking with Jekyll might\nbe a better choice for your needs.\n      \n    \n  \n\nNone of these seem like dealbreakers to me.  What about the themes?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCan a Jekyll theme be ported to Zola?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, a Jekyll theme can be ported to Zola, but it requires some manual work.\nJekyll and Zola have different templating engines and folder structures, so\nyou'll need to make adjustments to the theme to make it compatible with Zola.\nHere's a rough outline of the steps involved:\n\n\nFolder structure: Zola has a different folder structure than Jekyll. Create\na new Zola project and reorganize the theme files to fit Zola's folder\nstructure. Mainly, you'll need to move the layout files to the templates\nfolder, and assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images to the static folder.\n\n\nTemplating engine: Jekyll uses the Liquid templating engine, while Zola uses\nTera. You'll need to convert the Liquid templates to Tera templates.\nAlthough both engines share similarities, there are differences in syntax,\nfilters, and tags. Update the template files to use Tera syntax and replace any\nLiquid-specific functionality with Tera equivalents.\n\n\nFrontmatter: Update the frontmatter in the content files to match Zola's\nTOML or YAML format.\n\n\nPagination and taxonomies: If the Jekyll theme uses pagination or taxonomies\n(categories, tags), configure Zola to handle these features. Zola has\nbuilt-in support for pagination and taxonomies, but you'll need to set them up\naccording to the theme's requirements.\n\n\nPlugins: If the Jekyll theme relies on any plugins, you'll need to find\nequivalent functionality in Zola or create custom shortcodes or components\nto replicate the plugin features.\n\n\nSass/SCSS: If the Jekyll theme uses Sass or SCSS, you can take advantage of\nZola's built-in Sass compilation. Make sure to update any import paths in\nyour Sass files to match Zola's folder structure.\n\n\nTest and adjust: Once you've made all the necessary changes, test the Zola\ntheme thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected. Make any\nadjustments or bug fixes as needed.\n\n\nPorting a theme from Jekyll to Zola can be a time-consuming process, but it\nallows you to use your preferred theme with the benefits of Zola's features and\nperformance.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, I'd rather not start out by trying to port a theme, but it's a\npossibility to keep in mind.  But what is this SCSS?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat is SCSS?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSCSS (Sassy CSS) is a syntax for Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets),\nwhich is a CSS preprocessor. It extends the capabilities of CSS by introducing\nfeatures like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more. SCSS aims\nto make working with CSS more maintainable, structured, and efficient.\nSCSS is similar to CSS in terms of syntax and uses curly braces and semicolons,\nwhich makes it easier for developers familiar with CSS to adapt to. Here's a\nquick comparison of CSS and SCSS:\nCSS:\n.navigation {\n  background-color: #333;\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.navigation a {\n  color: white;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  padding: 5px;\n}\n\nSCSS:\n$bg-color: #333;\n$link-color: white;\n\n.navigation {\n  background-color: $bg-color;\n  padding: 20px;\n\n  a {\n    color: $link-color;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n}\n\nIn the SCSS example, we use variables ($bg-color and $link-color) to store\ncolor values and nested rules for .navigation a. These features make it easier\nto maintain and organize your styles.\nWhen SCSS is compiled, it generates standard CSS that browsers can understand.\nUsing tools like Zola or other build systems, you can easily integrate SCSS\ncompilation into your development workflow.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSounds useful.  I figured this question was a long shot:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs there any automated tool to convert Liquid templates to Tera?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere isn't a dedicated automated tool to directly convert Liquid templates to\nTera templates. Since Liquid and Tera have differences in syntax and\nfunctionality, it's difficult to create a fully automated conversion tool that\nhandles all possible cases.\nHowever, you can manually convert Liquid templates to Tera templates by\nfollowing these general steps:\n\n\nStudy the differences between Liquid and Tera syntax and understand their\nrespective features.\n\n\nReplace Liquid tags, filters, and expressions with their Tera equivalents.\n\n\nTest the converted templates to ensure they produce the desired output.\n\n\nIt's essential to familiarize yourself with both Liquid and Tera documentation\nto understand how each template language works and make the necessary\nadjustments during the conversion process.\nLiquid Documentation: https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\nTera Documentation: https://tera.netlify.app/docs/\n      \n    \n  \n\nI decided to try Zola, but there was still the comment system to consider.\nThat will be the subject of tomorrow's\npost.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/","title":"Choosing a blogging platform."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/23/choosing-a-comment-system/":{"body":"My lengthy conversation with ChatGPT continues!  In yesterday's\npost, I decided to use Zola as the\nblogging platform.  Now I have to figure out how to integrate a comment system\ninto a static site generator...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI think I'll try using Zola.  What are the best privacy-oriented options to\nintegrate comment support into a Zola site, keeping all data locally?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFor a Zola site, you can consider using privacy-oriented, self-hosted\ncommenting systems that allow you to keep data under your control. Some options\nto consider are:\n\n\nRemark42: A lightweight, self-hosted commenting system with Markdown support\nand without any tracking features. It's easy to embed into your Zola site\nand keeps data on your server.\n\n\nIsso: A self-hosted commenting system that is also lightweight and simple to\nintegrate into a Zola site. It doesn't use third-party trackers and stores\ndata on your server.\n\n\nCommento: A self-hosted, privacy-focused commenting system that is easy to\nintegrate and manage. It doesn't include any trackers, and you can control\nthe data storage.\n\n\nThese commenting systems can be installed on your server, and then you can\nembed them into your Zola site. Remember that you'll need to have a server to\nhost these systems, as they require server-side components to store and manage\nthe comments.\n      \n    \n  \n\nDid ChatGPT forget already?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAs we already discussed, I already signed up for the KVM VPS with\nBuyVM/FranTech, so I'll have a place to host it.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThat's great! With your KVM VPS from BuyVM/FranTech, you have the necessary\nresources to host a self-hosted commenting system. You can choose one of the\nprivacy-oriented options I mentioned earlier (Remark42, Isso, or Commento) and\nset it up on your VPS.\nTo get started, you will need to:\n\n\nInstall the required dependencies for your chosen commenting system (usually\ndocumented in the project's README or installation guide).\n\n\nConfigure the commenting system according to your preferences and the\nrequirements of your Zola site.\n\n\nIntegrate the commenting system into your Zola site by adding the necessary\ncode snippets to your templates or content files.\n\n\nOnce you have set up the commenting system on your VPS and integrated it with\nyour Zola site, you'll be able to manage and store comments locally while\nmaintaining your users' privacy.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHow do Remark42, Isso and Commento compare with each other?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nRemark42, Isso, and Commento are all self-hosted, privacy-focused commenting\nsystems. Each of them has its own set of features and differences that you may\nwant to consider when choosing the best option for your website.\n\nRemark42:\n\nWritten in Go.\nSupports social login (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) and anonymous\ncommenting.\nCan import and export comments.\nOffers moderation tools, like editing, deleting, and pinning comments.\nProvides an upvote/downvote system and comment sorting options.\nCan be used as a replacement for Disqus.\n\nIsso:\n\nWritten in Python.\nSupports anonymous commenting only (no social login).\nOffers moderation tools, like deleting comments.\nProvides an upvote/downvote system and comment sorting options.\nCan import and export comments.\nLightweight and easy to set up.\n\nCommento:\n\nWritten in Go.\nSupports social login (Google, Twitter, GitHub, etc.) and anonymous\ncommenting.\nOffers moderation tools, like editing, deleting, and approving comments.\nProvides an upvote/downvote system and comment sorting options.\nCan import and export comments.\nHas a clean and modern user interface.\n\n\nAll three options are privacy-focused and store the data locally, but they\ndiffer in features and implementation. Your choice will depend on your\npreferences, such as ease of setup, the availability of social logins, and the\nuser interface. Additionally, consider the programming language and potential\ncompatibility with your VPS setup.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, I can eliminate Isso.  I'll take Go over Python here, and social login is\na good idea.  Still, I'd rather have everything in Rust if I can.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAre there any good comment solutions implemented in Rust?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhile there aren't as many Rust-based commenting systems as there are in other\nlanguages, there are a few options you can consider:\n\n\nCactus Comments: Cactus Comments is a federated, self-hosted commenting\nsystem implemented in Rust. It uses the Matrix protocol, a decentralized\ncommunication protocol, for storage and synchronization of comments. This makes\nCactus Comments unique among commenting systems. However, as it is a relatively\nnew project, it may not have all the features and polish that more established\nsolutions offer.\n\n\nPlume: Plume is a federated blogging engine implemented in Rust. While it is\nnot a standalone commenting system, it includes a built-in commenting\nfeature. If you decide to use Plume for your blog instead of a static site\ngenerator like Zola, you will get a commenting system as part of the package.\n\n\nLemmy: Lemmy is a Rust-based, federated link aggregation and discussion\nplatform similar to Reddit. While it is not a dedicated commenting system\nfor blogs, you could potentially use it to host discussions related to your\nblog posts, and then embed or link to those discussions from your blog.\n\n\nIt's worth noting that the Rust ecosystem is growing, and new projects may\nemerge in the future. However, at this time, Cactus Comments is the primary\nRust-based option specifically focused on providing a self-hosted commenting\nsystem for blogs.\n      \n    \n  \n\nCactus Comments sounds very interesting, since I'm already interested in\nthe Matrix protocol anyhow.  Definitely an option to consider!\nPlume sounds like a tangent.  I've decided to go with Zola already, so I don't\nthink I'll be using Plume.  Lemmy seems similar, but perhaps a bit more\ninteresting.\nI searched Google for a Rust commenting system also, and found an article about\nanother comment system as well:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI found this:\nhttps://dev.to/netguru/commentable-rs-building-a-serverless-comment-system-in-rust-5egb\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCommentable.rs is a serverless comment system implemented in Rust, as described\nin the article you found. The system is built using Rust, AWS Lambda, and AWS\nDynamoDB. It is designed to be a lightweight and cost-effective solution for\nadding comments to static websites.\nTo use Commentable.rs, you will need to follow the steps outlined in the\narticle, which include:\n\n\nSetting up an AWS account and configuring the AWS CLI\n\n\nCreating an AWS DynamoDB table for storing comments\n\n\nDeploying the Rust Lambda function to handle comment submissions and\nretrieval\n\n\nIntegrating the commenting system into your static website using JavaScript\n\n\nPlease note that while Commentable.rs is an interesting project, it may not be\nas feature-rich or actively maintained as some of the more established\ncommenting solutions mentioned earlier.\nIf you're comfortable with AWS and prefer a serverless solution implemented in\nRust, you can give Commentable.rs a try. However, if you're looking for a more\nestablished solution with a larger community, you might want to consider other\noptions like Remark42, Isso, or Commento.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAlthough this does sound interesting, I think I'll set this one aside for now.\nAre there other Rust options out there?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat other Rust commenting solutions are you aware of?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there are not many mature,\nfeature-rich Rust-based commenting solutions available. Commentable.rs is one\nof the few projects that implement a commenting system in Rust. The Rust\necosystem is still growing, and more solutions may emerge in the future.\nThat said, you can always keep an eye on GitHub and other repositories to see\nif any new Rust-based commenting systems become available. It's also worth\nnoting that you can use commenting systems written in other languages with your\nRust-based site, as long as they provide a compatible API or frontend\nintegration.\nFor now, if you're looking for a more established commenting solution, you\nmight want to consider Remark42, Isso, or Commento, as mentioned earlier.\nAlthough they're not implemented in Rust, they are actively maintained and\nprovide a range of features for managing comments on static websites.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nYou mentioned Cactus Comments, Plume and Lemmy.  Are there other Rust options?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. Cactus Comments is a commenting system built\nusing the Matrix protocol, and its server component is indeed implemented in\nRust. Plume and Lemmy are Rust-based projects, but they serve different\npurposes: Plume is a federated blogging platform, and Lemmy is a federated link\naggregation and discussion platform, similar to Reddit.\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there are not many other mature\nRust-based commenting solutions available besides Cactus Comments. However, the\nRust ecosystem is growing, and new projects might emerge in the future. You can\nkeep an eye on GitHub and other repositories for updates on Rust-based\ncommenting systems.\nIf you're considering a commenting system for your static site now, Cactus\nComments is a Rust-based option, while Remark42, Isso, and Commento are more\nestablished solutions implemented in other languages.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nDoes Cactus Comments support social login?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Cactus Comments does not support\nsocial login directly. Cactus Comments uses the Matrix protocol for its\nbackend, so users need to have a Matrix account to comment. Matrix accounts can\nbe created on various homeservers, and some of these homeservers might support\nsocial login. In that case, users can log in to their Matrix account using\nsocial login and then use the same account for commenting on your site through\nCactus Comments.\nIt's worth noting that the landscape of commenting systems and their features\nis always evolving, so it's a good idea to check the Cactus Comments\ndocumentation and updates for the most recent information on supported\nfeatures.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHmm, despite how interesting Cactus Comments sounds, lack of support for social\nlogin might be a dealbreaker.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nMaybe I'll stick with Remark42 or Commento for the social login support.  What\nlicenses do they use?  Would it be difficult to port one of them to Rust?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nRemark42 is licensed under the MIT License, which is a permissive open-source\nlicense. Commento is licensed under the AGPLv3 License, which is a more\nrestrictive open-source license, requiring that any modifications or derived\nworks also be licensed under AGPLv3 if distributed.\nPorting either Remark42 or Commento to Rust would be a non-trivial task. You\nwould need to rewrite the entire codebase in Rust, including translating the\nlogic, data structures, and external library dependencies. It would require a\ngood understanding of both the original language (Go for Remark42 and\nJavaScript for Commento) and Rust, as well as knowledge about the specific\napplication's architecture and design.\nIf you are interested in pursuing this project, it would be a significant\nundertaking, but it could also be a valuable learning experience and an\ninteresting contribution to the open-source community. However, if your main\ngoal is to simply add a commenting system to your blog, it might be more\ntime-efficient to use one of the existing solutions.\n      \n    \n  \n\nRemark42 sounds like the better option, if I might ever want to try porting it\nto Rust, or \"rewrite it in Rust\" as the saying goes.  For now, I'll probably\nuse Remark42 and consider the possibility of porting it later sometime, or\nperhaps never!\nStill, if I'm hosting a static site elsewhere (such as GitHub Pages), it would\nbe nice if the comments could be somehow hosted with the site.  Time to explore\nthat possibility...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDoes either of them integrate the comments into the static site once posted, or\nwould my VPS need to serve comments directly to all clients?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBoth Remark42 and Commento serve comments dynamically to the clients, which\nmeans that the comments are not integrated into the static site as a part of\nthe build process. Instead, the comments are fetched from the server and\ndisplayed on the client-side when a user visits the page.\nYour VPS would need to host the commenting system and serve comments directly\nto all clients. When a visitor loads your blog post, the static page content is\nserved from your static site hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages), while the comments\nare fetched from your VPS running the commenting system.\nThis approach has the advantage of keeping your static site generation process\nsimple and fast while allowing for dynamic, real-time interactions like posting\nand fetching comments.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIs there a reasonable option for incorporating the comments into the static\nsite itself so the dynamic code is only needed for actually posting comments,\nnot reading them?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo incorporate comments into the static site itself, you would need to rebuild\nyour site each time a new comment is added. This can be done with a combination\nof a server-side script and a webhooks mechanism. The general process would\nlook like this:\n\n\nA user submits a comment through a form on your site.\n\n\nThe comment data is sent to your server (VPS), which processes the comment\nand stores it in a database.\n\n\nYour server triggers a webhook, notifying your static site generator (e.g.,\nZola) to rebuild the site.\n\n\nThe site generator pulls the latest comments from the database and\nincorporates them into the static pages.\n\n\nThe rebuilt site is deployed, now including the new comment(s).\n\n\nThis approach has its downsides, though. It can be more complex to set up and\nmaintain, and it might cause delays in comment display, as the entire site must\nbe rebuilt and redeployed for each new comment.\nIf you prefer this approach, you could use a combination of existing tools and\ncustom scripts to achieve it. For example, you could use a headless CMS (like\nNetlify CMS) to manage comments and trigger rebuilds via webhooks. Or, you\ncould build your own custom script to handle comment submissions, store them,\nand trigger site rebuilds.\nHowever, considering the potential downsides and complexity, it's generally\nmore practical to use a dynamic commenting system like Remark42 or Commento,\nwhich separates the comments from the static site generation process and serves\nthem directly to clients.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhy can't the comments be rendered in static HTML separately from generating\nthe static site and incorporate the static comment HTML somehow without\nre-generating the site?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn theory, you could render comments in static HTML separately from generating\nthe static site and incorporate the static comment HTML without re-generating\nthe entire site. To achieve this, you would need to implement a few steps:\n\n\nCreate a separate static HTML file for each comment or a single file\ncontaining all comments for a specific page.\n\n\nWhen a new comment is submitted, your server processes the comment, stores\nit in a database, and generates a new static HTML file containing the\ncomment or updates an existing file with the new comment.\n\n\nUse JavaScript on the client-side to fetch the static HTML file(s)\ncontaining the comments and inject them into the appropriate location on\nyour page.\n\n\nThis approach has some advantages, such as reducing the time it takes to\ndisplay new comments since the entire site doesn't need to be rebuilt. However,\nit also has a few downsides:\n\n\nIncreased complexity: This solution requires custom server-side scripts to\nhandle comment submissions, store comments, and generate/update static HTML\nfiles.\n\n\nMore client-side processing: Your users' browsers will need to fetch and\ninject the static HTML comment files, which could increase the time it takes\nfor comments to load and have an impact on performance.\n\n\nSEO: Search engines might not index comments as effectively since they are\nloaded asynchronously and not part of the original static HTML content.\n\n\nThis solution would be a custom hybrid approach, and while it's possible, it\nmight be more time-consuming and complex to implement than using an existing\ndynamic commenting system like Remark42 or Commento.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nPerhaps the comments could be incorporated into the static HTML directly as a\ntemplate substitution after the site as a whole has been generated, and just\nrepeat that substitution without regenerating the entire site, then check in\nthe updated page with the new comment into the Git repository and push it to\nGitHub so it is live on the site?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can incorporate comments into the static HTML directly as a template\nsubstitution after the site has been generated, and update only the relevant\npage without regenerating the entire site. Here's a high-level approach to\nachieve this:\n\n\nGenerate your static site using Zola or another static site generator.\n\n\nStore submitted comments in a database on your server, and have a\nserver-side script that fetches the relevant comments for a specific page.\n\n\nUse the server-side script to generate a static HTML file or a JSON file\ncontaining the comments.\n\n\nCreate a script or a tool to substitute the comments into the existing\nstatic HTML file of the specific page, replacing a placeholder or injecting\nthem into a specific location on the page.\n\n\nCommit the updated page with the new comment to the Git repository and push\nit to GitHub.\n\n\nThis method can work, but it has some downsides:\n\n\nIncreased complexity: You would need to develop and maintain custom\nserver-side scripts and a tool to handle comment submissions, fetch comments,\nand substitute them into the existing static HTML files.\n\n\nManual intervention: You may need to manually trigger the script or tool to\nupdate the static HTML files, commit them to Git, and push the changes to\nGitHub whenever a new comment is submitted.\n\n\nPotential Git repository bloat: As you update pages and commit them to the\nGit repository, the repository size will grow over time, possibly leading to\nslower clone and pull times.\n\n\nThis custom solution could work for your needs, but it might be more\ntime-consuming and complex to implement and maintain than using an existing\ndynamic commenting system like Remark42 or Commento that handles comment\nsubmissions, storage, and display out of the box.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI could imagine the comments being fetched from the site as a JSON file by\nclient-side JavaScript, but would that be SEO-friendly?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFetching comments using client-side JavaScript and displaying them dynamically\non the page might not be as SEO-friendly as having the comments directly\nembedded in the static HTML. Search engines, such as Google, have become better\nat indexing and understanding JavaScript-generated content. However, their\nability to index dynamic content can still be limited compared to static\ncontent.\nIf SEO is a high priority for your site, it's generally better to have the\ncomments directly embedded in the static HTML, as this ensures that search\nengines can easily crawl and index the content. Using a dynamic commenting\nsystem like Remark42 or Commento, which loads comments using JavaScript, might\nbe less optimal for SEO purposes.\nIf you still want to load comments through client-side JavaScript and want to\nimprove SEO, you could consider using server-side rendering (SSR) or\npre-rendering techniques to generate static HTML pages with comments included.\nThis approach can help search engines index the content more effectively.\nOverall, the best solution for SEO would be to have comments embedded directly\nin the static HTML, but it may not be feasible or practical, depending on your\nsetup and requirements.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAnd now for a bit of a detour...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOn a separate note, why the hell doesn't HTML support a standard way to\nincorporate HTML from a separate HTTPS request into another page using ONLY\nHTML/CSS???\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe reason HTML and CSS don't have a built-in mechanism for including HTML from\na separate HTTPS request is primarily due to their roles as markup and styling\nlanguages, respectively. HTML is designed to structure content, while CSS is\nfocused on styling the content. Neither language was designed to manage dynamic\ncontent loading or communication with external resources.\nHistorically, incorporating external content or executing logic required the\nuse of a scripting language like JavaScript, which is specifically designed for\nsuch tasks. JavaScript allows you to make AJAX requests to fetch external\ncontent, process it, and then insert it into the DOM. This provides a more\nflexible and powerful way to manage dynamic content, including loading content\nfrom external sources.\nIf you want to include an HTML snippet from another source without using\nJavaScript, you can use server-side languages, such as PHP or Python, to fetch\nthe external content and embed it in your HTML before serving it to the user.\nHowever, this approach is not purely HTML/CSS-based and requires a server-side\nprocessing step.\nIn summary, HTML and CSS were not designed to handle dynamic content loading or\nexternal resource fetching. These tasks are better suited for JavaScript or\nserver-side languages, which provide the necessary functionality and\nflexibility.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHTML has evolved over the years and this sort of template substitution is a\nVERY common need (e.g. common site navigation header), it should have been\nadded years ago.  The only rationale I've seen for it involved avoiding\nadditional HTTP requests, which is absolutely ridiculous given how many\ntypically happen already.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're right that HTML has evolved over the years, and there have been attempts\nto address the need for template substitution and reusable components in HTML.\nOne such approach was the HTML Imports specification, which was part of the Web\nComponents suite. However, HTML Imports were not widely adopted and have since\nbeen deprecated.\nThe current recommended approach to create reusable components is to use\nJavaScript frameworks or libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js. These tools\nprovide powerful and flexible ways to build reusable components, manage state,\nand handle user interactions. They leverage JavaScript to dynamically load and\nrender content, making it easier to build complex and interactive applications.\nHowever, if you're looking for a more lightweight, HTML-based solution, you can\nuse the `&lt;template&gt;` element in combination with JavaScript to create\nreusable components. The `&lt;template&gt;` element allows you to define a\nreusable piece of markup that can be cloned and inserted into the document\nusing JavaScript.\nAnother solution is to use server-side templating engines like Jinja,\nHandlebars, or Liquid, which can handle template substitution and partials\nbefore serving the HTML to the user.\nIt's worth noting that native HTML templating and component features might\nstill evolve in the future. The web platform is continuously improving, and new\nspecifications and proposals may emerge to address these needs more\neffectively.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, enough venting!\nWhat's this about Git repository bloat?  Just from comments?  Really?  I'm\nfinding that one hard to believe!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWell, that's neither here nor there right now.  If I check in updates to the\npage with the new comments, is Git repository bloat really a significant\nconcern?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGit repository bloat can become a concern if you're constantly updating and\ncommitting large files or making frequent changes to your pages. This can lead\nto a larger repository size, slower cloning times, and increased storage\nrequirements. However, for a blog with comments, the impact is likely to be\nminimal, as the text content of comments is typically small.\nIf you're worried about repository bloat, there are some strategies to mitigate\nthe issue:\n\n\nGit Large File Storage (LFS): If you have large files (e.g., images,\nvideos, or other binary files) that change frequently, you can use Git LFS\nto store these files more efficiently.\n\n\nGit history cleanup: You can perform periodic maintenance on your\nrepository using tools like `git filter-branch` or `BFG\nRepo-Cleaner` to remove unused large files, reduce the number of commits, or\nremove sensitive data from your Git history.\n\n\nShallow clones: If you're concerned about cloning times, you can use\nshallow clones (`git clone --depth 1`) to fetch only the latest commit\nhistory, which reduces the amount of data being transferred.\n\n\nFor a typical blog, though, these measures might not be necessary. The increase\nin repository size due to text-based comments is likely to be manageable. If\nyou start noticing issues with repository size or performance, you can consider\nthe strategies mentioned above.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan \"git gc\" be used to generate deltas in a pack file or is that not possible\non the GitHub side?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, `git gc` (garbage collection) can be used to generate deltas in a\npack file, which helps optimize the Git repository by compressing objects and\nreducing its size. The `git gc` command performs several housekeeping\ntasks, such as:\n\n\nRemoving unreachable objects from the object database\n\n\nCompacting loose objects into pack files\n\n\nReusing existing pack files to generate deltas\n\n\nPruning reflog entries\n\n\nExpiring old reflog entries\n\n\nHowever, when it comes to GitHub repositories, you don't have direct control\nover the server-side Git operations. GitHub automatically performs garbage\ncollection and other housekeeping tasks on their servers to optimize repository\nstorage.\nIn your local repository, you can use `git gc` to optimize storage and\nimprove performance. It's a good practice to run `git gc` periodically,\nespecially if you've made many changes or performed operations like merging and\nrebasing that generate a lot of loose objects.\nIf you notice your GitHub repository is bloated, you can try to clean up your\nlocal repository by running `git gc`, along with other maintenance\ncommands like `git prune`, and then push the cleaned-up repository back\nto GitHub. However, keep in mind that this might not have a significant impact\non the server-side repository size, as GitHub has its own garbage collection\npolicies and processes.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIs there any way to trigger \"git gc\" on the GitHub server?  If I run it on the\nclient side before the push, would that do any good?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou cannot directly trigger `git gc` on the GitHub server, as GitHub\nautomatically runs garbage collection and other housekeeping tasks on their\nside. They have their own policies and schedule for running such operations.\nRunning `git gc` on the client-side before pushing can still be\nbeneficial, as it can help optimize your local repository and improve its\nperformance. It can also reduce the size of the objects you're pushing to the\nremote repository on GitHub, which might have a small impact on the server-side\nrepository size.\nHowever, it's important to note that running `git gc` on the client-side\nwon't have a direct or significant impact on the server-side repository size,\nas GitHub manages garbage collection and optimization independently.\nIn summary, it's still a good practice to periodically run `git gc` in\nyour local repository to optimize it, but don't expect it to have a substantial\neffect on the server-side repository size on GitHub.\n      \n    \n  \n\nYeah, I didn't think that was possible, but you never know!  At any rate, I'm\nreally not worried about ending up with gigabytes of comments.\nMight as well see if ChatGPT has any suggestions on the static HTML idea...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf I use Remark42, how can I generate static HTML with the comments to substitute into the page when a new comment is added?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nRemark42 does not support generating static HTML with comments out-of-the-box,\nbut you can achieve this using a custom script. Here's a high-level overview of\nthe steps you can take:\n\nFetch comments in JSON format from Remark42 API:\nRemark42 provides a RESTful API that you can use to fetch the comments for a\nspecific post. Send a GET request to the following URL, replacing\n`YOUR_REMARK42_DOMAIN`, `SITE_ID`, and `URL` with appropriate\nvalues:\n\nhttps://YOUR_REMARK42_DOMAIN/api/v1/find?site=SITE_ID&amp;url=URL\n\n\n\nParse the JSON and convert it to HTML:\nOnce you have the JSON data with the comments, you can parse it using a script\n(e.g., Python, JavaScript/Node.js) to iterate through the comments and convert\nthem into the desired HTML structure. You can use any HTML structure and CSS\nclasses that fit your website design.\n\n\nReplace or insert comments in the static HTML page:\nOpen your static HTML page and locate the appropriate section where you want to\ninsert the comments. You can use a placeholder or an HTML comment as a marker.\nYour script should then replace or insert the generated HTML with the comments\nat the correct location in the file.\n\n\nUpdate and push changes to your repository:\nAfter updating the static HTML page with the new comments, commit the changes\nto your Git repository and push the changes to the remote repository (e.g.,\nGitHub Pages).\n\n\nRemember that this approach requires you to manually run the script each time a\nnew comment is added. Alternatively, you can automate the process using a\nserver-side script, webhook, or a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fetch\nnew comments and update your static pages automatically.\nWhile this solution allows you to incorporate comments as static HTML, it might\nnot be the most efficient or scalable approach, especially for websites with\nfrequent comment activity. Keep this in mind when deciding on a comment system\nfor your static site.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI need to keep monetization in mind also.  I noticed that some Jekyll themes\ninclude AdBlock detection; that seems like a good idea.  I use an ad blocker,\nand I read that 33% of Internet users do too.  But I also routinely disable it\nfor sites with content I want to read.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat about AdBlock detection?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAdBlock detection can be useful for publishers who want to detect if users have\nan ad blocker enabled and show a message requesting them to disable it or\nsupport the site in another way (e.g., donations or subscriptions). However,\nsome users may find this intrusive, so it's important to balance the user\nexperience with the revenue generation.\nHere's a simple way to implement AdBlock detection using JavaScript:\n\n\n\n\nCreate an HTML element that mimics an ad:\nIn your HTML file, add a hidden HTML element with a class name that is\ntypically blocked by ad blockers, like `adsbox`. This element acts as\nbait for ad blockers:\n&lt;div class=\"adsbox\" style=\"height: 1px; width: 1px; position: absolute; left: -1000px;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\nAdd a JavaScript function to check for the presence of the bait element:\nIn your JavaScript file or within a `&lt;script&gt;` tag, add the following\nfunction to check if the bait element is still in the DOM and visible:\nfunction checkAdBlock() {\n  const adsBox = document.querySelector('.adsbox');\n  if (!adsBox || adsBox.offsetHeight === 0 || adsBox.offsetWidth === 0) {\n    // AdBlock is enabled, show a message or execute custom code\n    console.log('AdBlock detected.');\n  } else {\n    // AdBlock is disabled, proceed as usual\n    console.log('No AdBlock detected.');\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nCall the `checkAdBlock()` function:\nInvoke the `checkAdBlock()` function, preferably after the DOM content\nhas loaded:\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', checkAdBlock);\n\nThis code checks for the presence and visibility of the bait element when the\npage loads. If the element is not found or is hidden, it assumes that an ad\nblocker is enabled and logs a message to the console.\n\n\nIn this example, we're just logging a message to the console, but you can\nreplace that part with custom code to display a message to the user, asking\nthem to disable their ad blocker or support your site in another way. Keep in\nmind that some ad blockers might also block scripts that detect ad blockers, so\nyour detection method might not always be 100% effective.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis is a good stopping point; the topic of my next\npost will be the search for a theme to\nuse for the blog.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/23/choosing-a-comment-system/","title":"Choosing a comment system."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/05/05/choosing-a-website-theme/":{"body":"Continuing the conversation with ChatGPT, in my last\npost, I decided to use Remark42 as the\ncomment system for this blog.  Next, I need to choose a website theme to use\nfor the blog with the Zola static site generator.\n\nAs an aside, it's been almost 2 weeks since my last post.  I was aiming to post\non a daily basis as long as I could, mainly to establish a habit of posting\nregularly.  I didn't think I'd be able to maintain a daily pace for long, but I\ntried!  I'm not going to worry about posting daily anymore.  Hopefully once or\ntwice a week is a more realistic goal; time will tell.\nAs I've said before, I figure that I might as well put ads on this blog.\nGoogle AdSense and Outbrain seem like good options to consider.  I wanted to\nkeep in mind how well each theme lends itself to integrating ads, such as\nhaving good locations to put ads in the theme's layout.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhich Zola themes would be the best to use for my blog with Google AdSense?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nZola does not have many themes with built-in Google AdSense support, but you\ncan easily integrate AdSense into any theme. Here are a few themes that you can\nconsider for your blog, and I'll provide instructions on how to add Google\nAdSense to them:\n\n\nZerm: https://www.getzola.org/themes/zerm/\n\n\nDeepThought: https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/\n\n\nBook: https://www.getzola.org/themes/book/\n\n\nAfter Dark: https://www.getzola.org/themes/after-dark/\n\n\nTo integrate Google AdSense into any of these themes, follow these steps:\n\n\nSign up for a Google AdSense account if you haven't already, and obtain your\nad code.\n\n\nChoose the theme you want to use and follow its installation instructions.\n\n\nIdentify where you want to place the ads on your site. Common locations\ninclude the header, sidebar, and in between blog post content.\n\n\nOpen the corresponding HTML template file for the location where you want to\nadd the ad. For example, if you want to add an ad to the sidebar, open the\n`sidebar.html` file.\n\n\nPaste your Google AdSense code into the appropriate location within the HTML\ntemplate file. Make sure to place the code within an appropriate HTML\ncontainer, such as a `&lt;div&gt;` or `&lt;aside&gt;`.\n\n\nSave your changes and rebuild your site with Zola. The ads should now appear\non your site.\n\n\nRemember to comply with Google AdSense policies and guidelines when adding ads\nto your site.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI guess there isn't much out-of-the-box support in Zola themes for Google\nAdSense.  Oh well.  If I have to add it manually, then so be it.  Doesn't seem\nlike a dealbreaker to me.  (I'm guessing there are probably more Jekyll and\nespecially WordPress themes with out-of-the-box support.)\nOkay, what about the \"F-shaped\" layout that ChatGPT mentioned earlier in the\nconversation?  I've read about that elsewhere too; something about the \"F\"\nshape being found as the results of an eye-tracking study...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDoes Zola have any professional-looking themes with the F-shaped layout?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nZola does not have a large number of themes compared to other static site\ngenerators like Jekyll or Hugo. However, you can still find some\nprofessional-looking themes that you can modify to achieve the F-shaped layout.\n\n\nZerm: https://www.getzola.org/themes/zerm/\n\n\nDeepThought: https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/\n\n\nBook: https://www.getzola.org/themes/book/\n\n\nThese themes can be customized to follow the F-shaped layout by making changes\nto their CSS and HTML template files. To do this, consider the following:\n\n\nChoose a theme that closely resembles the desired layout and follow the\ninstallation instructions.\n\n\nIdentify the areas in the theme you want to modify to achieve the F-shaped\nlayout, such as the header, navigation menu, and main content area.\n\n\nOpen the corresponding HTML template files (e.g., `header.html`,\n`nav.html`, and `index.html`) and CSS files to make the\nnecessary changes.\n\n\nApply CSS styles and modify the HTML structure to create an F-shaped layout,\nfocusing on the header, navigation menu, and main content area.\n\n\nSave your changes and rebuild your site with Zola.\n\n\nRemember that you may need some knowledge of HTML and CSS to modify the themes\neffectively. Keep experimenting with the layout until you achieve the desired\nlook.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis isn't a huge surprise.  Zola isn't as popular as Jekyll or WordPress, so\nof course that means more limited availability of themes to choose from.  Sure,\nI could change my mind about the blogging platform and use Jekyll or WordPress\ninstead, but I'm not sure if I want to do that.  If I find a really good theme\nfor another platform, it might be worth trying to port it to Zola instead...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOkay, maybe I'll try porting a theme to Zola.  What are the best\nprofessional-looking F-shaped layout themes for Jekyll or WordPress?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHere are some professional-looking F-shaped layout themes for Jekyll and\nWordPress that you can consider porting to Zola:\nJekyll Themes:\n\n\nMinimal Mistakes: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/\n\n\nChirpy: https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy\n\n\nAlembic: https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic\n\n\nWordPress Themes:\n\n\nAstra: https://wpastra.com/\n\n\nOceanWP: https://oceanwp.org/\n\n\nGeneratePress: https://generatepress.com/\n\n\nWhen porting a theme from Jekyll or WordPress to Zola, you'll need to convert\nthe template files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and adapt the theme to use Zola's\ntemplating engine (Tera) and folder structure.

However, once you've successfully ported the theme, you'll\nhave a unique and professional-looking Zola theme tailored to your needs.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, these are options to keep in mind if I decide to tackle porting a theme\nto Zola.  For now, I'd rather get things rolling with one of the existing Zola\nthemes that are available out of the box.  None of them seemed perfect, but\nthere were a couple that seemed good enough for now.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo avoid the work of porting a theme for now, I'm leaning towards using the\nZola DeepThought or Pickles theme.  Which would be better?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBoth DeepThought and Pickles are good themes for Zola, and the choice between\nthem depends on your personal preference and the specific features you're\nlooking for. Here's a brief overview of each theme to help you decide:\nDeepThought:\n\n\nSimple, clean design with a focus on content\n\n\nResponsive layout that works well on various devices\n\n\nFeatures a minimalistic navigation menu\n\n\nIncludes built-in support for syntax highlighting\n\n\nIntegrates Disqus for comments (you can replace this with your preferred\ncommenting system)\n\n\nPickles:\n\n\nClean, modern design with a sidebar\n\n\nResponsive layout for different devices\n\n\nCustomizable sidebar with support for adding widgets\n\n\nFeatures a sticky header for better navigation\n\n\nIncludes built-in support for syntax highlighting\n\n\nIntegrates Disqus for comments (you can replace this with your preferred\ncommenting system)\n\n\nIf you prefer a theme with a sidebar and sticky header, Pickles might be a\nbetter choice. If you're looking for a simpler, more minimalistic design,\nDeepThought may be more suitable. Ultimately, the best theme for your blog will\ndepend on your personal preferences and the specific features you value most.\nRemember that you can always customize the theme to better fit your needs once\nyou've selected one.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI might as well double-check for other Zola alternatives, in case I dismissed a\ngood option too quickly.  I think this is somewhat redundant with my earlier\nquestions to ChatGPT, but who cares?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAm I missing other good choices in the Zola themes?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere are several other Zola themes that you might find interesting. While not\nall of them follow the F-shaped layout, they are still worth considering. Here\nare a few more options:\n\n\n\n Zerm: https://www.getzola.org/themes/zerm/\n\n\n\n Minimal, responsive design\n\n Customizable sidebar\n\n Syntax highlighting\n\n Dark mode support\n\n\n\n Paper: https://www.getzola.org/themes/paper/\n\n\n\n Clean, minimalist design\n\n Responsive layout\n\n Syntax highlighting\n\n Disqus integration for comments (replaceable)\n\n\n\n After Dark: https://www.getzola.org/themes/after-dark/\n\n\n\n Dark-themed design\n\n Responsive layout\n\n Built-in shortcodes\n\n Customizable header and footer\n\n\n\n Anpu: https://www.getzola.org/themes/anpu/\n\n\n\n Simple, clean design\n\n Responsive layout\n\n Syntax highlighting\n\n Supports pagination\n\n\n\n Sam: https://www.getzola.org/themes/sam/\n\n\n\n Minimal, responsive design\n\n Customizable sidebar\n\n Syntax highlighting\n\n Disqus integration for comments (replaceable)\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that these themes may require some customization to fully integrate\nfeatures like Google AdSense and your preferred commenting system. It's\nessential to browse the theme's documentation and demo to get a better\nunderstanding of the features and the design before making a decision.\n      \n    \n  \n\nNope, I don't think so.  I looked through each of these, and all of them were\nless appealing to me than DeepThought or Pickles.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI don't care for any of those.  Would Pickles or DeepThought be easier to\nintegrate AdSense with good ad placement?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBoth Pickles and DeepThought are customizable themes, and you can integrate\nAdSense into either of them. However, considering their designs, the Pickles\ntheme might be easier to work with when integrating AdSense and placing ads\noptimally.\nThe Pickles theme has a more structured layout, with a sidebar that could be\nused for ad placement. It also features a clean design with clear content\nsections, which can help you find suitable locations for ads within the\ncontent.\nOn the other hand, the DeepThought theme has a more minimalistic design and\nlacks a sidebar. Although you can still integrate AdSense and place ads within\nthe content, you might need to make more significant modifications to the theme\nto achieve optimal ad placement.\nIn either case, you will need to modify the theme's templates and CSS to\ninclude the AdSense code and style the ad placements according to your\npreferences. It's essential to familiarize yourself with the theme's structure\nand Zola's templating system (Tera) to make these customizations effectively.\n      \n    \n  \n\nUnfortunately, there currently isn't a live demo site for the Pickles theme\nlike there is for DeepThought, so it's a little harder to evaluate from\nscreenshots alone...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs there a live demo site for pickles?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAs of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, there isn't a dedicated live\ndemo site for the Pickles theme. However, you can quickly set up a local demo\nsite using the theme to see how it looks and works.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\n\nInstall Zola: First, ensure you have Zola installed on your system. You can\nfollow the installation instructions on the official Zola website:\nhttps://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/\n\n\nCreate a new Zola project: Open your terminal/command prompt and run the\nfollowing command to create a new Zola project:\n\n\nzola init my_pickles_demo\n\nReplace `my_pickles_demo` with any name you prefer for the demo project.\n\nChange the current directory to the newly created project:\n\ncd my_pickles_demo\n\n\nDownload the Pickles theme: Clone the Pickles theme repository into the\n`themes` directory of your Zola project:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Leopere/Pickles themes/pickles\n\n\nConfigure the theme: Open the `config.toml` file in your Zola project\nand set the `theme` parameter to \"pickles\":\n\ntheme = \"pickles\"\n\n\nServe the demo site: Run the following command to start a local server for\nyour demo site:\n\nzola serve\n\n\nView the demo site: Open your web browser and navigate to\n`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. You should now see the Pickles theme in\naction.\n\nFeel free to customize the content and configuration of your demo site to see\nhow the theme behaves with different settings and content types.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, if I'm going to setup a test site to get a better sense of the Pickles\ntheme, I might as well try to make a sample blog post too.  But how should the\nblog post URLs be organized?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nShould I put the blog posts at the root of the content tree or in a \"blog\"\nsection?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOrganizing your blog posts in a \"blog\" section is generally a better choice,\nespecially if you plan to have other types of content on your website. Having a\ndedicated \"blog\" section allows for better organization and maintainability, as\nwell as providing a clear structure for your site.\nTo create a \"blog\" section in Zola, follow these steps:\n\n\nCreate a new folder named `blog` inside the `content` folder of\nyour Zola project.\n\n\nInside the blog folder, create a `_index.md` file. This file will\nserve as the index page for your blog section and can include information\nabout the section, such as its title and description.\n\n\nHere's an example of a basic `_index.md` file for a \"blog\" section:\n+++\ntitle = \"Blog\"\ndescription = \"A collection of my thoughts and experiences.\"\nsort_by = \"date\"\ntemplate = \"section.html\"\n+++\n\nWelcome to my blog!\n\n\nPlace your blog posts as Markdown files inside the `blog` folder.\n\nBy organizing your blog posts in a \"blog\" section, you can easily extend your\nwebsite in the future with additional sections, such as \"portfolio\", \"about\",\nor \"projects\".\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould the blog post URLs contain the date of the post?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIncluding the date in the blog post URLs is a matter of personal preference and\ndepends on the structure and goals of your website. Here are some pros and cons\nto consider when deciding whether to include the date in your URLs:\nPros:\n\n\nIt provides a clear indication of when the post was published, which can be\nhelpful for readers who want to gauge the relevance and timeliness of the\ncontent.\n\n\nIt helps to create a unique URL for each post, reducing the risk of\nduplicate URLs.\n\n\nSome search engines may use the date in the URL as a ranking factor, which\ncould potentially affect your search engine optimization (SEO).\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nIncluding the date can make the URL longer and less readable.\n\n\nIf you update the content of a post and want to change the publication date,\nyou will need to update the URL as well, which can lead to broken links and\npotential SEO issues.\n\n\nSome users may perceive older content as less relevant, even if the\ninformation is still accurate and valuable.\n\n\nIf you decide to include the date in your blog post URLs, you can configure\nZola to do so by modifying the `path` field in your `config.toml`\nfile. For example:\n[extra]\npath = \"/blog/{year}/{month}/{day}/{slug}\"\n\nThis configuration will generate URLs like\n`/blog/2023/03/28/my-blog-post`.\nUltimately, the decision to include the date in your URLs depends on your\npreferences and the specific needs of your website. Consider the pros and cons,\nand choose the option that best suits your goals.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThat \"path\" parameter didn't do anything.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion. You should use the `path` parameter within\nthe `[taxonomies]` section of your `config.toml` file. Here's the\ncorrect way to configure the date in the URL for Zola:\n\n\nOpen the `config.toml` file in your Zola project.\n\n\nUnder the `[taxonomies]` section, add the following configuration:\n\n\n[taxonomies]\n  # Other taxonomies, if any, should be configured here.\n\n  [taxonomies.extra]\n  path = \"blog/{year}/{month}/{day}/{slug}\"\n\n\nSave the `config.toml` file.\n\nThis configuration will generate URLs like\n`/blog/2023/03/28/my-blog-post`. Make sure to rebuild your Zola project\nfor the changes to take effect.\nHowever, if this still doesn't work, it's possible that the specific theme\nyou're using has a custom configuration that overrides the default behavior. In\nthat case, you'll need to check the theme's documentation or look into the\ntheme's templates to find out how to customize the URL structure.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCheck the pickles theme and tell me if it has such an override.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The correct way to\nchange the URL structure in Zola is by using the `slug` attribute in the\nfrontmatter of individual content pages, and not in the `config.toml`.\nUnfortunately, there isn't a global setting for this.\nAs for the Pickles theme, it doesn't have any specific overrides for the URL\nstructure. However, since you can't set the date in the URL structure via the\n`config.toml`, you'll have to set the `slug` attribute in each\ncontent page.\nFor example, if you want your blog post to have a URL like\n`/blog/2023/03/28/my-blog-post`, you would create a file with the\nfollowing frontmatter:\n+++\ntitle = \"My Blog Post\"\ndate = 2023-03-28\nslug = \"blog/2023/03/28/my-blog-post\"\n+++\n\nYour blog post content goes here.\n\nYou can use the date variable within the content file to avoid having to\nmanually set the year, month, and day. However, you will still need to set the\nslug attribute for each content page.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI found a relevant forum\nthread\nabout creating directories for dates.  I asked ChatGPT about it...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI found this post:\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of the thread.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBased on the discussion in the Zola repository, it seems that the Zola\nmaintainers are not in favor of adding an automatic date-based URL scheme as a\nbuilt-in feature. However, they've shared a couple of workarounds that could be\nuseful for achieving this structure.\n\n\nManually create transparent `_index.md` files for each year, month,\nand day, and set their `render` and `transparent` properties\naccordingly. This approach requires maintaining many `_index.md` files,\nwhich could be cumbersome.\n\n\nKeep the original content structure (e.g.,\n`content/foo/yyyy-mm-dd-slug.md`) and manually set the `slug`\nattribute in the frontmatter of each post to include the date (e.g., `slug =\n\"yyyy/mm/dd/slug\"`). This would require turning off automatic slugification\nto preserve slashes in the slug.\n\n\nIt's important to note that neither of these workarounds are officially\nsupported by Zola, and they could be prone to user errors. However, they may\nstill work as temporary solutions for achieving the desired URL structure.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI also found a GitHub\nissue in the Zola repository which\nis relevant to using custom URLs like this.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGitHub issue:\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of the GitHub issue.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt seems that custom URL templates are a requested feature by several users,\nand there are valid reasons to support them. However, as of the last comment on\nthe issue, it appears that the Zola team has not yet fully embraced the idea of\nsupporting custom URL templates.\nKeats, a collaborator on the project, suggested that an option to integrate the\ndate in the path might be sufficient for most use cases, rather than\nimplementing full-blown custom URL patterns. This suggestion, however, may not\ncover all the needs of users looking for more control over their URL\nstructures.\nIf you feel strongly about this feature and its importance, you can consider\nreopening the issue or creating a new one, detailing your specific use case and\nrequirements. Alternatively, you can fork the Zola project and implement the\ndesired functionality yourself or collaborate with others who share your\ninterest in this feature. If your implementation is successful and\nwell-received, it may eventually be incorporated into the main Zola project.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, if Zola doesn't have proper support for such URLs, maybe I can find a\nworkaround.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nInstead of manually setting the \"slug\" attribute, should I manually set \"path\"\ninstead?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, if you want to have full control over the URL structure of your content in\nZola, you can manually set the `path` attribute in the front matter of\nyour content files. This way, you can define the exact URL you want for each\ncontent item.\nSetting the `path` attribute overrides the default URL generation that\nZola uses, which is based on the `slug` attribute. By manually setting\nthe `path`, you can create custom URLs for your content that may not\nfollow the default pattern.\nHere's an example of how to set the `path` attribute in the front matter\nof a Markdown file:\n+++\ntitle = \"My custom URL post\"\npath = \"/custom/url/structure/for/this/post/\"\n+++\n\nContent goes here.\n\nRemember that manually setting the `path` attribute for each content item\ncan be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for large sites.  It's\nimportant to be consistent with your URL structure to avoid broken links and\nimprove the maintainability of your project.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nTo follow the WordPress URL standard, what should the path be?  Is it useful to\nalso set the slug, or is that pointless if setting the path?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo follow the WordPress URL standard, which usually includes the date and post\nslug in the URL (e.g., `/YYYY/MM/DD/post-slug/`), you should set the\n`path` attribute in the front matter of your content files in Zola. When\nyou set the `path` attribute, it's not necessary to set the `slug`\nattribute, as the `path` will override the default URL generation that\nZola uses based on the `slug`.\nHere's an example of how to set the `path` attribute to follow the\nWordPress URL standard:\n+++\ntitle = \"My WordPress-style post\"\ndate = 2023-03-28\npath = \"/2023/03/28/my-wordpress-style-post/\"\n+++\n\nContent goes here.\n\nIn this example, the date is manually added to the `path` attribute to\nmatch the WordPress URL structure. However, manually adding dates to the\n`path` can be tedious and error-prone. Unfortunately, as of my knowledge\ncutoff in September 2021, Zola doesn't have built-in support for custom URL\ntemplates that automatically include date components in the URL. If this is a\ncrucial feature for your project, you might want to consider other static site\ngenerators that support custom URL templates, like Hugo or Jekyll.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIs the blank line after the second +++ required or optional?  Should the path\ncontain a trailing slash?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe blank line after the second `+++` is optional. However, it's good\npractice to include it for readability, as it visually separates the front\nmatter from the content.\nAs for the trailing slash in the `path`, it's optional too. Zola will\nhandle the URL correctly with or without the trailing slash. However, for\nconsistency, you might want to choose one approach and stick to it across all\nyour content files. Including a trailing slash is a common practice, as it\ngives the impression of a directory structure, but it's ultimately up to you to\ndecide what works best for your project.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nDoes the generated static HTML actually create a subdirectory with index.html\nwhen using the trailing slash?  Will it do so without the trailing slash?\nWhich is more standard for WordPress sites?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, when using a trailing slash in the `path`, Zola generates a\nsubdirectory with an `index.html` file. For example, if you set the\n`path` to `/blog/my-post/`, Zola will create the following\nstructure:\nblog\n  └─ my-post\n      └─ index.html\n\nIf you don't use a trailing slash, Zola will generate an HTML file with the\nsame name as specified in the `path`. For example, if you set the\n`path` to `/blog/my-post`, Zola will create the following\nstructure:\nblog\n  └─ my-post.html\n\nAs for WordPress sites, the more common approach is to use a trailing slash,\nwhich creates a subdirectory with an `index.html` file. This is the\ndefault behavior in WordPress when using \"pretty\" permalinks. If you want to\nfollow the WordPress standard, it's better to use a trailing slash in the\n`path`.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, this is a workable solution.  Time to explore the details of Zola's\nhandling of dates and timestamps, and how content posts are sorted...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf using \"sort_by = date\" and there are multiple posts with the same date, how\nare they sorted?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen using `sort_by = \"date\"` and there are multiple posts with the same\ndate, Zola will sort them based on their file creation order (the order in\nwhich they were added to the filesystem). If you want more control over the\nsorting, you can use the `weight` attribute in your content front matter.\nTo sort by weight, set `sort_by = \"weight\"` in your section\n`_index.md` file. Then, in the front matter of each content file,\nspecify the `weight` attribute with a numerical value. Lower weights will\nbe displayed before higher weights.\nFor example, if you have three posts with the same date:\n\n\nPost A: weight 1\n\n\nPost B: weight 2\n\n\nPost C: weight 3\n\n\nThe sorting order will be Post A, Post B, and then Post C.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIs it better to use RFC3339 format dates?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing RFC3339 format dates is a good choice as it provides a standardized and\nunambiguous representation of dates and times. This format is widely used and\nwell-supported in most programming languages, including Rust, which Zola is\nbuilt upon.\nRFC3339 format looks like this: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00` (or\n`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` for UTC). It specifies the date, time, and\ntimezone offset, ensuring that your date and time data is precise and clear.\nHowever, you don't need to use the RFC3339 format in your content front matter\nfor Zola. Zola accepts more human-readable date formats like `YYYY-MM-DD`\nfor the `date` attribute in the front matter. For most use cases, this\nsimpler format is sufficient and easier to read and write.\nTo sum up, while RFC3339 is an excellent choice for machine-readable date\nrepresentations, for Zola's front matter, the simpler `YYYY-MM-DD` format\nis usually more convenient and sufficient.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhat will Zola do differently if the timestamp is included?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn Zola, if you include the timestamp in the `date` attribute in the front matter, it will be used for sorting and filtering purposes when generating the site. The main difference is the added precision when ordering content based on date and time.\nFor example, when you use the timestamp in the date, the sorting of the pages will be more precise, as it will take the time of the day into account. This is especially useful if you have multiple pages or posts published on the same day.\nHowever, if you don't include the timestamp, Zola will consider only the date part, and any content with the same date will have an unspecified order relative to each other when sorted by date.\nIncluding the timestamp can be beneficial if you need more precise sorting or filtering based on the publishing time. If the time of day is not important for your use case, you can continue to use the simpler `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI could use YYYY-MM-DD normally and only add the timestamp when there are multiple posts on the same day?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can use the `YYYY-MM-DD` format for your dates normally, and\nonly add the timestamp when there are multiple posts on the same day. This way,\nyou'll have the added precision for ordering and filtering only when needed.\nZola will handle both formats without any issues.\nJust make sure to use the RFC3339 format for the date and time, like this:\n`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, where the\n`T` separates the date and time components, and the `+00:00` or\n`Z` indicate the timezone offset.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIf there is one post with the date only and another with the timestamp, what is\nthe implied timestamp of the date-only post for sorting purposes?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen Zola encounters a post with a date-only format (without a timestamp), it\nwill internally treat the timestamp as the start of the day (00:00:00) for\nsorting purposes.\nSo, if you have one post with the date `2023-04-01` and another post with\nthe timestamp `2023-04-01T12:34:56+00:00`, Zola will sort the date-only\npost as if its timestamp were `2023-04-01T00:00:00+00:00`.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAt the start of the day in what time zone?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen a date-only format is used in Zola, it's treated as if it were in the UTC\ntimezone. So, if you have a post with the date `2023-04-01`, Zola will\ninternally treat it as `2023-04-01T00:00:00+00:00`, which means the start\nof the day in the UTC timezone.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCouldn't that confuse things if another post uses local time?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, using a mix of date-only and date-time formats with different time zones\ncan potentially lead to confusion and unexpected sorting results. Ideally, you\nshould consistently use one format and time zone for all your posts to avoid\nany issues.\nIf you choose to use date-time format with local time for some posts, it's\nrecommended to stick with that format and use the same time zone for all your\ncontent to ensure consistency and avoid confusion when it comes to sorting and\ndisplay.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAfter comparing the DeepThought theme and Pickles theme side-by-side, I decided\nthat I prefer the DeepThought theme, but it doesn't come with the handy sidebar\nthat could be used for ads.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI really like the DeepThought theme better.  How hard would it be to add a\nsidebar to it?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAdding a sidebar to the DeepThought theme is not too difficult if you have some\nbasic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Zola's templating system. Here's a general\noutline of the steps you need to follow:\n\n\n\n Create a new HTML file for the sidebar (e.g., **`_sidebar.html) in\nthe `templates` directory of the DeepThought theme. Add the necessary\nHTML code for your sidebar, such as navigation links or other widgets you want\nto include.\n\n Open the `base.html` file in the `templates` directory.\nThis file serves as the foundation for the other templates in the theme. Locate\nthe `main` element or a similar wrapper element, and add the following\ncode to include the sidebar:\n{% include \"\\_sidebar.html\" %}\n\nPlace this line of code where you want the sidebar to appear within the layout.\nFor example, if you want the sidebar to appear on the left side of the main\ncontent, place the code before the content section.\n\n Adjust the CSS styles to accommodate the new sidebar. Open the\n`style.css` file in the `static/css` directory and add or modify\nthe necessary CSS rules to style the sidebar and adjust the layout of the main\ncontent area. You may need to update the width of the content area, add some\npadding or margin, and style the sidebar elements.\n\n Test your changes by running the Zola development server (`zola\nserve`) and inspecting the layout in your browser. Make any necessary\nadjustments to the HTML and CSS code until you're satisfied with the appearance\nof the sidebar.\n\n Commit your changes to the theme and rebuild your site to see the\nnew sidebar in action.\n\n\nRemember to customize the sidebar's content according to your needs, and ensure\nit's visually consistent with the rest of the DeepThought theme.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, I'll worry about that later when I try to actually implement ads.\nZola's documentation suggests cloning the git repository for the theme into the\ntheme directory.  That's a bad idea; it should be added as a git submodule.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe Zola documentation suggests doing a \"git clone\" of a theme repo into the\ntheme directory, but if the site as a whole is in Git, won't this cause\nproblems, to nest one git repo within another?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, nesting one Git repository inside another can cause problems and\nconfusion. To avoid this, you can use Git Submodules to manage your theme\nwithin your main site's Git repository.\nGit Submodules allow you to include an external Git repository within your main\nrepository while keeping them separate. This way, you can track changes in both\nrepositories independently, and you can update the theme as needed without\ninterfering with your main site repository.\nTo add a theme as a Git submodule, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n Navigate to your Zola site's root directory in your terminal or\ncommand prompt.\n\n Run the following command, replacing `theme-name` with the\ndesired name for the theme directory, and `theme-repo-url` with the Git\nURL of the theme repository:\ngit submodule add theme-repo-url themes/theme-name\n\n\n After the command completes, you'll notice a new `.gitmodules`\nfile in your site's root directory. This file keeps track of the submodules and\ntheir configurations. Make sure to commit this file to your main site's Git\nrepository.\n\n Update your Zola site's `config.toml` file to set the\n`theme` value to the `theme-name` you used in step 2:\ntheme = \"theme-name\"\n\n\n To update the theme later, navigate to the theme's directory\n(`themes/theme-name`) and run:\ngit pull origin main\n\nReplace `main` with the appropriate branch name if it's different.\n\n Finally, commit any updates to your main site's Git repository to\nkeep track of the theme changes.\n\n\nBy using Git Submodules, you can manage your theme within your site's Git\nrepository without causing issues related to nested repositories.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHow can the submodule be used on the GitHub server side for GitHub Pages?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUnfortunately, GitHub Pages does not support Git Submodules directly for\nbuilding and deploying the site. However, you can use GitHub Actions to build\nyour Zola site with the submodule, and then deploy the generated static files\nto the `gh-pages` branch for serving with GitHub Pages.\nHere's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy your\nZola site with a theme submodule:\n\n\nCreate a new file named\n`.github/workflows/zola_build_and_deploy.yml` in your main site\nrepository.\n\n\nAdd the following content to the `zola_build_and_deploy.yml` file:\n\n\nname: Build and Deploy Zola Site\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main  # Replace 'main' with the name of your default branch if it's different\n\njobs:\n  build_and_deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          submodules: 'recursive'  # Fetch the submodule for the theme\n\n      - name: Setup Zola\n        uses: getzola/setup-zola@v1\n\n      - name: Build Site\n        run: zola build\n\n      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          publish_dir: ./public\n\nThis workflow will trigger whenever you push to the main branch of your site's\nrepository. It checks out the repository, including the submodule for the\ntheme, sets up Zola, builds the site, and deploys the generated files to the\n`gh-pages` branch.\n\n\nCommit and push the `.github/workflows/zola_build_and_deploy.yml`\nfile to your repository.\n\n\nMake sure that your GitHub Pages settings are configured to serve the site\nfrom the `gh-pages` branch.\n\n\nWith this setup, your Zola site with the theme submodule will be built and\ndeployed automatically using GitHub Actions, and served by GitHub Pages.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nActually, if GitHub Pages is serving the static HTML, does it know or care\nabout the theme directory anyhow?  It's only used during site generation,\nright?  Maybe it doesn't matter.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct. GitHub Pages only serves the static HTML files generated by\nZola, and it does not need to know or care about the theme directory. The theme\nis used during the site generation process, which happens locally on your\ncomputer or through a build process using a tool like GitHub Actions.\nAs long as you generate the static HTML files before pushing them to the\n`gh-pages` branch (or whichever branch you're using for GitHub Pages), it\ndoesn't matter where the theme comes from or how it's structured. The generated\nsite will contain all the necessary assets, such as CSS and JavaScript files,\nto render your site correctly. The theme directory and any associated Git\nsubmodule or repository are not needed by GitHub Pages to serve the site.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis seems like a good stopping point for today.  After searching and comparing\nvarious options, I've decided to use the Zola DeepThought theme.  My next post\nwill cover the details of fine-tuning the theme for this blog, and debugging\nproblems that I encountered while doing this.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/05/05/choosing-a-website-theme/","title":"Choosing a website theme."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/05/13/fine-tuning-the-website-theme/":{"body":"Continuing my endless conversation with ChatGPT, in my last\npost, I decided to use Zola's\nDeepThought theme for this blog.  I figured out how to emulate WordPress-style\nURLs, but there were still a number of other details I needed to iron out.\nDecisions, decisions...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhich is a better way to refer to the blog?  \"Code Reflections\" or\n\"CodeReflections\"?  With or without a space?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe choice between \"Code Reflections\" and \"CodeReflections\" is a matter of\npersonal preference and depends on the style you want to convey. Both options\nare valid, but they give off slightly different vibes:\n\n\n\"Code Reflections\": This option uses a space, which makes it more readable\nand easy to understand. It gives off a more formal and traditional feel.\nIt's also easier to read for non-native English speakers.\n\n\n\"CodeReflections\": This option combines the words into one, creating a more\nmodern and casual feel. It has a more tech-oriented or brand-like vibe to\nit.\n\n\nConsider your target audience and the overall tone you want your blog to have\nwhen making this decision. There's no right or wrong answer; it's about what\nfeels best for your particular blog and audience.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI decided to go with \"CodeReflections\" for the \"more modern and casual feel\".\nWhile trying to implement the DeepThought theme, I wanted to move all the blog\nposts to the top level of the site instead of putting them all under a\n/posts/ URL base path.  This was trickier than expected; the content files\nfor test posts I was experimenting with worked fine under the original\n/posts/ URL base path, but when I moved them to the root, they vanished!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI've got the DeepThought theme mostly working I think, but when I tried moving\nall the posts from the /posts/ section to the top level of content, the posts\nwon't display on the home page, though the right number of pages is displayed.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo display the posts on the homepage when you move them from the\n`/posts/` section to the top level of the content, you need to update the\ntemplates that are responsible for displaying the posts. In the DeepThought\ntheme, the file you need to modify is `templates/index.html`.\nIn the `templates/index.html` file, you'll find a block of code that\nlooks like this:\n{% for page in paginator.pages %}\n  {% if page.path starts_with(\"posts\") %}\n    // ... code to display a post ...\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n\nThe `if` condition here is checking if the page's path starts with\n\"posts\". Since you moved your posts to the top level, you need to change the\ncondition to match your new structure. You can either remove the `if`\ncondition or modify it to match your specific needs.\nFor example, if you want to display all pages on the homepage, you can remove\nthe condition like this:\n{% for page in paginator.pages %}\n  // ... code to display a post ...\n{% endfor %}\n\nOr, if you want to display only the pages with a specific path or a specific\ncondition, update the `if` condition accordingly.\nAfter updating the template, save the file and rebuild your site using `zola\nbuild`. This should now display your posts on the homepage as expected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThis is the index.html template:\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;section class=\"section\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"has-text-centered\"&gt;\n      &lt;h1 class=\"title is-2\"&gt;{{ section.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"subtitle is-4\"&gt;{{ section.description }}&lt;/p&gt;\n      {% if config.extra.author.avatar %}\n      &lt;figure class=\"image is-flex is-justify-content-center is-align-items-center\"&gt;\n        &lt;img class=\"is-rounded\" src=\"{{ config.extra.author.avatar }}\" style=\"max-width: 192px\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/figure&gt;\n      {% endif %}\n      {{ macros:: social_links( social_config=config.extra.social) }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n      {{ section.content | safe }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt seems like the `index.html` template you've shared is missing the loop\nfor displaying the posts. You need to add the loop to display the posts on the\nhomepage. Here's an example of how to do that:\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;section class=\"section\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"has-text-centered\"&gt;\n      &lt;h1 class=\"title is-2\"&gt;{{ section.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"subtitle is-4\"&gt;{{ section.description }}&lt;/p&gt;\n      {% if config.extra.author.avatar %}\n      &lt;figure class=\"image is-flex is-justify-content-center is-align-items-center\"&gt;\n        &lt;img class=\"is-rounded\" src=\"{{ config.extra.author.avatar }}\" style=\"max-width: 192px\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/figure&gt;\n      {% endif %}\n      {{ macros:: social_links( social_config=config.extra.social) }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n      {{ section.content | safe }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Add the loop for displaying posts --&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"columns is-multiline\"&gt;\n      {% for page in paginator.pages %}\n        &lt;div class=\"column is-one-third\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"card-content\"&gt;\n              &lt;p class=\"title is-4\"&gt;\n                &lt;a href=\"{{ page.permalink }}\"&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n              &lt;p class=\"subtitle is-6\"&gt;{{ page.description }}&lt;/p&gt;\n              &lt;p class=\"is-size-7 has-text-grey\"&gt;\n                {{ page.date | date(format=\"%B %e, %Y\") }}\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      {% endfor %}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\nThis code adds a loop for displaying the posts in a 3-column grid. Customize\nthe loop according to your preferences, such as adjusting the number of columns\nor the styling.\nAfter updating the template, save the file and rebuild your site using `zola\nbuild`. This should now display your posts on the homepage as expected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWell, this is the page.html template, maybe it's using this instead of\nindex.html?\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block title %}\n{{ config.title }} | {{ page.title }}\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;section class=\"section\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"columns\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"column is-8 is-offset-2\"&gt;\n        &lt;article class=\"box\"&gt;\n          &lt;h1 class=\"title\"&gt;\n            {{ page.title }}\n          &lt;/h1&gt;\n          &lt;p class=\"subtitle\"&gt;{{ page.description }}&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"columns is-multiline is-gapless\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column is-8\"&gt;\n              {{ macros::page_publish_metadata(page=page) }}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column is-4 has-text-right-desktop\"&gt;\n              {{ macros::page_content_metadata(page=page) }}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column\"&gt;\n              {% if page.taxonomies.categories %}\n              {{ macros::render_categories(categories=page.taxonomies.categories) }}\n              {% endif %}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column has-text-right-desktop\"&gt;\n              {% if page.taxonomies.tags %}\n              {{ macros::render_tags(tags=page.taxonomies.tags) }}\n              {% endif %}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"content mt-2\"&gt;\n            {{ page.content | safe }}\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/article&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      {% if page.extra.toc %}\n      &lt;div class=\"column is-2 is-hidden-mobile\"&gt;\n        &lt;aside class=\"menu\" style=\"position: sticky;

When you moved\nthe posts from the `/posts/` section to the top level of the\n`content` directory, the `section.html` template is no longer being\nused for the homepage.\nTo fix this, you can modify the `index.html` template in the DeepThought\ntheme directory to include the code that was responsible for displaying the\nlist of blog posts in the `section.html` template. You can find the code\nfor rendering the list of pages in the `section.html` template, usually\ninside a loop such as `{% for page in section.pages %} ... {% endfor %}`.\nCopy the code from the loop and add it to the `index.html` template where\nyou want the list of blog posts to appear.\nIf you are unable to locate the `section.html` template or need help\nmodifying the `index.html` template, please provide the contents of the\n`section.html` file, and I can help you with the necessary changes.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThis is the section.html template:\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block title %}\n{{ config.title }} | {{ section.title }}\n{% endblock title %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;section class=\"section\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"has-text-centered\"&gt;\n      &lt;h1 class=\"title is-2\"&gt;{{ section.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"subtitle is-4\"&gt;{{ section.description }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n      {{ section.content | safe }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"columns is-centered\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"column is-9\"&gt;\n        {% if paginator %}\n        {% set pages = paginator.pages %}\n        {% else %}\n        {% set pages = section.pages %}\n        {% endif %}\n\n        {% for page in pages %}\n        &lt;article class=\"box\"&gt;\n          &lt;h2 class=\"title\"&gt;\n            &lt;a class=\"has-text-dark\" href='{{ page.permalink }}'&gt;\n              {{ page.title }}\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n          &lt;/h2&gt;\n          &lt;p class=\"subtitle\"&gt;{{ page.description }}&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"columns is-multiline is-gapless\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column is-8\"&gt;\n              {{ macros::page_publish_metadata(page=page) }}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column is-4 has-text-right-desktop\"&gt;\n              {{ macros::page_content_metadata(page=page) }}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"content mt-2\"&gt;\n            {{ page.summary | safe }}\n            &lt;a class=\"has-text-danger-dark has-text-weight-semibold\" href='{{ page.permalink }}'&gt;\n              Read More\n              &lt;span class=\"icon is-small\"&gt;\n                &lt;i class=\"fas fa-arrow-right fa-xs\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n              &lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;/a&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"columns\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column\"&gt;\n              {% if page.taxonomies.categories %}\n              {{ macros::render_categories(categories=page.taxonomies.categories) }}\n              {% endif %}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"column has-text-right-desktop\"&gt;\n              {% if page.taxonomies.tags %}\n              {{ macros::render_tags(tags=page.taxonomies.tags) }}\n              {% endif %}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/article&gt;\n        {% endfor %}\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n{% endblock %}\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThanks for providing the `section.html` template.

Make sure to modify the `index.html` template in\nthe DeepThought theme directory with the provided code, and it should display\nthe blog posts on the homepage as expected.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis solved the problem with posts not appearing on the top-level page.  Moving\non, there's also taxonomies for tags and categories to figure out...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYup, that fixed it.  What should I be doing with taxonomies?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTaxonomies in Zola are a way to categorize and organize your content. By\ndefault, Zola supports two taxonomies: `tags` and `categories`. You\ncan use taxonomies to group related content together and make it easier for\nyour site visitors to find and navigate through your content.\nHere's a brief guide on how to work with taxonomies in Zola:\n\nConfigure taxonomies in `config.toml`:\n\nBy default, Zola has the following taxonomies configured in\n`config.toml`:\n[taxonomies]\n  [[taxonomies]]\n    name = \"categories\"\n    paginate_by = 5\n\n  [[taxonomies]]\n    name = \"tags\"\n    paginate_by = 5\n\nYou can modify the `paginate_by` value if you want to change the number\nof items displayed per taxonomy page.\n\nAdd taxonomies to your content:\n\nIn your content's front matter, you can add tags and categories. For example,\nin a Markdown file for a blog post:\n+++\ntitle = \"My Blog Post\"\ndate = 2023-03-28\ntags = [\"tutorial\", \"zola\"]\ncategories = [\"web development\"]\n+++\n\nThis is my blog post content.\n\n\nCreate taxonomy templates:\n\nCreate a template for each taxonomy in your theme's `templates`\ndirectory. For example, create a `tags.html` and a\n`categories.html` template. These templates will be used to generate the\npages for each tag and category.\n\nList taxonomies on your site:\n\nYou can use the `get_taxonomy_url` function to generate URLs for your\ntaxonomies. For example, you can add a list of tags to your site's sidebar or\nfooter using the following code in your template:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n{% for tag in tags %}\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"{{ get_taxonomy_url(kind=\"tags\", name=tag) }}\"&gt;\n      {{ tag }}\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nReplace `\"tags\"` with `\"categories\"` if you want to list categories\ninstead.\n\nDisplay taxonomies on individual content pages:\n\nThe DeepThought theme already includes code for displaying tags and categories\non individual content pages (see the `page.html` and `section.html`\ntemplates you provided earlier). You can modify these templates if you want to\nchange how taxonomies are displayed on your site.\nRemember to rebuild your site after making changes to your templates or\ncontent, so that the changes are reflected on your site.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAs an aside, I decide to mention that I put the template override in the right\nplace instead of following ChatGPT's instructions to the letter.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBy the way, I put the updated \"index.html\" template in my templates directory,\nnot the one for the theme.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThat's perfectly fine. When you put the `index.html` template in your\nsite's `templates` directory, Zola will use this template instead of the\none provided by the theme. This is a common practice when customizing themes,\nas it allows you to override specific templates without modifying the original\ntheme files.\nThis approach has the advantage of keeping your customizations separate from\nthe theme, so if the theme gets updated in the future, you can easily update it\nwithout losing your changes. Just remember that if the theme's\n`index.html` template is updated, you might need to manually incorporate\nthose updates into your customized template to keep it in sync with the theme's\nchanges.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAnyway, back to the taxonomies...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nOne of the example content files started with this:\n+++\ntitle=\"Fourth Post\"\ndate=2018-09-24\n\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"Sample Post\"]\ntags = [\"post\", \"lorem\"]\n+++\n\nAre you saying that the [taxonomies] section heading above is unnecessary?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, that's correct. In Zola, you can directly use the `categories` and\n`tags` keys under the front matter without the need for the\n`[taxonomies]` section heading.  The example you provided can be\nsimplified to:\n+++\ntitle=\"Fourth Post\"\ndate=2018-09-24\ncategories = [\"Sample Post\"]\ntags = [\"post\", \"lorem\"]\n+++\n\nZola will correctly parse the `categories` and `tags` without the\n`[taxonomies]` section heading. However, if the `[taxonomies]`\nsection is already in your content files, it won't cause any issues, as Zola\nwill still recognize and parse the taxonomies correctly. It's just that the\nsection heading is not necessary.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIs that just a special case for tags and categories?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, it's a special case for `tags` and `categories`, as they are\nthe default taxonomies in Zola. In the Zola configuration file (usually\n`config.toml`), the default taxonomies are defined like this:\n[taxonomies]\nname = \"categories\"\nname = \"tags\"\n\nZola is designed to work with these two taxonomies out of the box, which is why\nyou can directly use `categories` and `tags` keys in the front\nmatter without the need for an additional section heading.\nIf you want to use custom taxonomies, you need to define them in the\n`config.toml` file, and in that case, you'll use the custom taxonomy name\nas a key in the front matter. For example, if you have a custom taxonomy called\n\"authors\":\n[taxonomies]\nname = \"authors\"\n\nYou can use it in the front matter like this:\n+++\ntitle=\"Example Post\"\ndate=2023-03-28\nauthors = [\"John Doe\", \"Jane Smith\"]\n+++\n\nIn summary, `tags` and `categories` are special cases because they\nare the default taxonomies in Zola, and you can use them directly in the front\nmatter without additional section headings. Custom taxonomies can also be used\ndirectly as keys in the front matter once they are defined in the\n`config.toml` file.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhat sort of category names and tag names should I use?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCategory and tag names should be chosen based on the topics and themes of your\nblog content. They should be descriptive, concise, and easy to understand by\nyour readers. Here are some general tips for selecting category and tag names:\n\n\n\n Categories: Categories are generally broader and describe the\nmain topics of your blog. They should be limited in number to avoid diluting\ntheir purpose. For a programming blog, examples of category names could be:\n\n\n\n Web Development\n\n Mobile Development\n\n Data Science\n\n DevOps\n\n Programming Languages\n\n\n\n Tags: Tags are more specific than categories and can be used to\ndescribe the details of your content. They can be more numerous than categories\nand can be used to group related content across categories. For a programming\nblog, examples of tag names could be:\n\n\n\n JavaScript\n\n Python\n\n React\n\n Machine Learning\n\n Git\n\n\n\n\nWhen choosing category and tag names, consider the following:\n\n\n\n Use descriptive and meaningful names that convey the topic or theme\nclearly.\n\n Choose names that are easy to understand and remember for your\nreaders.\n\n Keep category names broader and limit their number to keep your\ncontent organized.\n\n Use more specific tag names to group related content across\ncategories.\n\n Be consistent in your naming conventions and style (e.g.,\ncapitalization, plural or singular forms).\n\n\nRemember, categories and tags are meant to help readers navigate your content\nmore easily, so choose names that are helpful and relevant to your target\naudience.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould Perl and Rust be categories, or just tags?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nPerl and Rust would be better suited as tags rather than categories, as they\nare specific programming languages. Categories should be broader and encompass\nlarger themes or topics, while tags can be more specific and help readers find\ncontent related to particular subjects, like programming languages.\nFor example, you could have a category like \"Programming Languages\" that covers\na wide range of languages, and then use tags like \"Perl\" and \"Rust\" to denote\ncontent specifically related to those languages. This way, your blog will be\nmore organized, and your readers will be able to easily find content related to\ntheir interests.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nDo I need a category for every post?  Should I have an \"Other\" category?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's not necessary to have a category for every post, but having categories can\nhelp you organize your content and make it easier for readers to find related\nposts. If you feel that a post doesn't fit into any of your existing\ncategories, you can use an \"Other\" category or a more descriptive category name\nthat is broad enough to accommodate such posts.\nHowever, keep in mind that having too many categories can make your blog appear\ncluttered and disorganized. It's better to have a reasonable number of\ncategories that cover the main topics of your blog and use tags to further\nnarrow down the content. If you find that you're frequently using the \"Other\"\ncategory, consider reevaluating your category structure and see if there's a\nmore appropriate category you can create to better organize your content.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhat's a good category for posts like the initial one?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFor an initial post, you might consider using a category like \"Introduction,\"\n\"Welcome,\" or \"Getting Started.\" These categories convey that the post is meant\nto introduce readers to your blog or provide some background information about\nthe blog's purpose and goals. This can help set the tone for future content and\ngive your readers a starting point when they first visit your blog.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWould it be better to use a category like \"Admin\" or \"Meta\" or \"Blog\" or\nsomething?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing a category like \"Admin,\" \"Meta,\" or \"Blog\" can also work well for initial\nor administrative posts. These categories indicate that the content is related\nto the blog's management, structure, or organization, rather than being focused\non a specific technical topic. Choose the category that resonates with you and\nreflects the purpose of the post. There is no strict rule on which one to use,\nso go with the one that you think fits best in the context of your blog.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhich one seems best to you?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn the context of your blog, I would recommend using the \"Meta\" category for\ninitial or administrative posts. This category implies that the content is\nrelated to the blog's structure and organization, while not being too specific\nor too broad. It should work well to cover various topics related to blog\nmanagement and updates.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSpeaking of non sequiturs...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI may also create a separate personal blog later.  I do already have older web\npages I posted many years ago that were functionally like blog posts; would it\nmake sense to integrate those into a blog as backdated posts?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, integrating your older web pages as backdated blog posts can be a great\nidea. It will help you organize your content in a chronological manner and\nprovide a more cohesive experience for your readers. Additionally, it can show\nthe progression of your thoughts and experiences over time, adding depth to\nyour blog.\nWhen you import these older web pages as blog posts, make sure to set the\ncorrect date in the front matter of each post. This will ensure they appear in\nthe correct order in your blog's archive. Also, you may want to review and\nupdate the content if necessary, to ensure it remains relevant and accurate.\nIf you create a separate personal blog, you could either include these older\nposts in that blog or cross-link between the two blogs, depending on the nature\nof the content and how you want to structure your online presence.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWouldn't that lead to some confusion though, with the initial welcome post\nbeing after the backdated ones?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's true that having the initial welcome post after the backdated ones might\ncreate some confusion for readers who are browsing your blog chronologically.\nTo address this, you have a few options:\n\n\nUpdate the welcome post date: You can change the date of your initial\nwelcome post to be the earliest post on your blog, so it appears before the\nbackdated ones. This way, it will still serve as an introduction for new\nreaders who browse your blog from the beginning.\n\n\nAdd a note to the welcome post: You can add a note in your welcome post\nexplaining that some of the content on your blog has been backdated to\nreflect the original publication dates. This way, your readers will understand\nthe chronology and the purpose of the backdated posts.\n\n\nCreate a separate section or category: You can create a separate section or\ncategory for your older web pages, like \"Archive\" or \"Older Posts.\" This\nway, your backdated content will be separate from your more recent blog posts,\nand the welcome post will still be the first post in the main blog section.\n\n\nWhichever option you choose, it's essential to provide clear navigation and\ncontext to your readers, so they understand the structure of your blog and can\neasily find the content they're interested in.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI'm not really sure about the number of posts per page...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThis theme defaults to paginating by groups of 5 posts, perhaps because each\nincludes a summary paragraph.  Still, is 5 per page too few?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe ideal number of posts per page depends on your specific content and the\npreferences of your target audience. While five posts per page might be\nsuitable for some blogs, it might not be the best choice for everyone.\nHere are some factors to consider when deciding on the number of posts per\npage:\n\n\nPost length: If your posts are long and include a summary paragraph, having\nfewer posts per page can help keep the page from becoming too cluttered and\noverwhelming for readers.\n\n\nPage load time: Displaying too many posts per page can increase the page\nload time, which could negatively impact your site's performance and user\nexperience. Consider keeping the number of posts per page relatively low to\nensure faster load times.\n\n\nUser preferences: Consider the preferences of your target audience. Some\nreaders may prefer a longer list of posts to browse through, while others\nmay prefer shorter pages that are easier to navigate.\n\n\nAesthetic appeal: The overall design and layout of your theme can also\ninfluence the number of posts per page. Aim for a balance between aesthetic\nappeal and functionality.\n\n\nIf you think five posts per page is too few, you can experiment with increasing\nthe number of posts per page to see how it affects the user experience. Try\ndifferent numbers like 7, 10, or even 15, and monitor your site's performance\nand user engagement to determine the optimal number for your blog.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I add a dropdown or input field to let the user change the number of posts\nper page according to their own preferences?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can add a dropdown or input field that allows users to change the\nnumber of posts per page according to their preferences. To implement this\nfunctionality, you'll need to use JavaScript, along with updating your\ntemplates.\nHere's a simple example using JavaScript and a dropdown menu:\n\nAdd a dropdown menu to your template (e.g., `section.html`):\n\n&lt;select id=\"postsPerPage\"&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"5\"&gt;5 Posts per page&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"10\"&gt;10 Posts per page&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=\"15\"&gt;15 Posts per page&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n\n\nAdd JavaScript to handle the user's selection and store it in the browser's local storage:\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const postsPerPageDropdown = document.getElementById('postsPerPage');\n  const storedPostsPerPage = localStorage.getItem('postsPerPage');\n\n  // Set the initial value from local storage or default value\n  if (storedPostsPerPage) {\n    postsPerPageDropdown.value = storedPostsPerPage;\n  } else {\n    localStorage.setItem('postsPerPage', postsPerPageDropdown.value);\n  }\n\n  // Update local storage when the user changes the selection\n  postsPerPageDropdown.addEventListener('change', () =&gt; {\n    localStorage.setItem('postsPerPage', postsPerPageDropdown.value);\n    // Reload the page to update the number of posts per page\n    location.reload();\n  });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIn your Zola configuration file (`config.toml`), add the following line\nto enable JavaScript processing:\ncompile_sass = true\n\n\nModify the pagination logic in your template to use the number of posts per\npage from local storage. This part can be challenging since Zola's\npagination is set in the configuration file. You'll need to write custom\nJavaScript to fetch the pages and display them based on the user's preference.\nThis may involve fetching the pages through AJAX or adjusting the number of\nvisible posts on the page using JavaScript.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and may require further adjustments\nbased on your theme and specific requirements. This example also assumes that\nyou're comfortable working with JavaScript and modifying Zola templates.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI decided to just set it to 10 posts per page, but infinite scrolling would be\nnice too...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAlternatively, can an \"infinite scrolling\" approach work here or is that\nincompatible with a static site?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nInfinite scrolling can work with static sites, but it requires a different\napproach compared to dynamic websites. For a static site like one built with\nZola, you'll need to use JavaScript to load more content as the user scrolls\ndown the page.\nHere's a simple example of how you can implement infinite scrolling on a\nZola-based static site:\n\nFirst, you need to set up your pagination in `config.toml`. You can\nkeep the default value of 5 posts per page or adjust it according to your\npreference.\n\npaginate_by = 5\n\n\nIn your `section.html` template, add a unique ID to the container that\nholds your list of posts:\n\n&lt;div id=\"postsContainer\" class=\"column is-9\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ... Your posts loop and other content ... --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nAdd a hidden element that will store the next page's URL:\n\n&lt;input type=\"hidden\" id=\"nextPage\" value=\"{{ paginator.next_page | safe }}\"&gt;\n\n\nAdd JavaScript to handle the infinite scrolling:\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const postsContainer = document.getElementById('postsContainer');\n  const nextPageInput = document.getElementById('nextPage');\n  let nextPageUrl = nextPageInput.value;\n\n  function fetchNextPage() {\n    fetch(nextPageUrl)\n      .then((response) =&gt; response.text())\n      .then((html) =&gt; {\n        const parser = new DOMParser();\n        const doc = parser.parseFromString(html, 'text/html');\n        const newPosts = doc.getElementById('postsContainer').innerHTML;\n        const nextPage = doc.getElementById('nextPage').value;\n\n        // Append new posts to the existing list\n        postsContainer.innerHTML += newPosts;\n\n        if (nextPage) {\n          nextPageUrl = nextPage;\n        } else {\n          nextPageUrl = null;\n          window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);\n        }\n      });\n  }\n\n  function handleScroll() {\n    const scrollPosition = window.scrollY + window.innerHeight;\n    const documentHeight = document.documentElement.scrollHeight;\n\n    if (scrollPosition &gt;= documentHeight - 200 &amp;&amp; nextPageUrl) {\n      fetchNextPage();\n    }\n  }\n\n  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThis JavaScript code will fetch and append the next page's content when the\nuser scrolls close to the bottom of the page. The posts will keep loading as\nlong as there are more pages available.\nKeep in mind that this is a simple example and may require further adjustments\nbased on your specific theme and requirements. This example assumes that you're\ncomfortable working with JavaScript and modifying Zola templates. Additionally,\nthis approach may not work well with browsers that have JavaScript disabled or\nlimited network connectivity.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nPresumably, if JavaScript is disabled, the original pagination will still work\nas a fallback.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, that's correct. If JavaScript is disabled or not supported, the user will\nsee the original pagination, and they can navigate through the pages using the\npagination links provided by the theme. The infinite scrolling functionality is\nan enhancement that makes the user experience smoother for those with\nJavaScript enabled, while still providing a usable and accessible experience\nfor those without it.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nDoes it affect SEO?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nInfinite scrolling can potentially affect SEO if not implemented correctly.\nHowever, since your site is a static site, it generates separate pages for each\npaginated set of posts, which helps in maintaining a good SEO structure. When\nusing infinite scrolling, you should ensure that the underlying HTML is\nstructured with proper pagination links, as in your case, so that search\nengines can crawl and index each paginated page correctly.\nTo further improve SEO, you can also add appropriate metadata to your pages,\nsuch as titles, descriptions, and structured data, which help search engines\nunderstand the content and context of each page.\nIn summary, as long as you have proper pagination links in place, infinite\nscrolling shouldn't have a negative impact on your site's SEO. In fact, it can\neven enhance the user experience, which is a positive signal for search\nengines.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShouldn't the JavaScript code for the infinite scrolling hide the pagination\nbuttons?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, if you implement infinite scrolling, it's a good idea to hide the\npagination buttons using JavaScript, as they would become redundant. This will\nprovide a cleaner and more seamless user experience. To hide the pagination\nbuttons, you can add a JavaScript code snippet that sets the `display`\nproperty of the pagination buttons to `none` when the infinite scrolling\nscript is active.\nHere's an example code snippet to hide the pagination buttons:\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  if (/* infinite scrolling is active */) {\n    const paginationButtons = document.querySelector('.your-pagination-buttons-selector');\n    if (paginationButtons) {\n      paginationButtons.style.display = 'none';\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nReplace `your-pagination-buttons-selector` with the appropriate CSS\nselector for your pagination buttons. This code snippet should be placed in the\nsame JavaScript file where you implement the infinite scrolling logic or inside\na `&lt;script&gt;` tag in your HTML template file.\nRemember that when JavaScript is disabled, the pagination buttons should still\nbe visible and functional as a fallback. So make sure to hide the pagination\nbuttons only when JavaScript is enabled and the infinite scrolling is active.\n      \n    \n  \n\nFixing the navigation bar to the top of the screen seems like a good idea...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow do I fix the top navigation bar to stick to the top of the window instead\nof scrolling off?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo fix the top navigation bar to stick to the top of the window, you need to\napply the CSS `position: fixed` property to the navigation bar element.\nYou may also need to adjust the `z-index` to ensure the navigation bar\nstays above other content.\nHere's an example of how you can update your CSS to achieve this:\n\n\nFirst, find the selector for your navigation bar element in your CSS or HTML\nfile. The selector might be something like `.navbar` or\n`#navbar` or any other class or ID used for the navigation bar.\n\n\nAdd the following CSS properties to the selector:\n\n\nCopy code\n.selector {\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  z-index: 1000;\n}\n\nReplace `.selector` with the actual selector you found in step 1.\n\nAfter fixing the navigation bar to the top of the window, you may find that\nthe content below it is hidden behind the navigation bar. To fix this, add a\n`padding-top` property to the main content container element to push it\ndown by the height of the navigation bar. For example, if your navigation bar\nis 60 pixels high:\n\n.content-container {\n  padding-top: 60px;\n}\n\nReplace `.content-container` with the appropriate selector for your main\ncontent container element.\nThat's it! The navigation bar should now be fixed to the top of the window and\nstay there when you scroll the page.\n      \n    \n  \n\nChatGPT said earlier that the [taxonomies] section header was optional, but\nwhen I tested that, it didn't actually work. 🙄\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou said that the [taxonomies] section header was optional in the front matter\nfor the tags/categories, but when I tried removing it from a couple of the\nsample posts, they stopped working.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion earlier. It seems that for your specific static\nsite generator, the `[taxonomies]` section header is indeed required. In\nthis case, you should include the `[taxonomies]` section header in the\nfront matter of your content files to ensure that the tags and categories are\nrecognized and processed correctly.\nHere's an example of the front matter format:\n+++\ntitle=\"Example Post\"\ndate=2022-01-01\n\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"Sample Category\"]\ntags = [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]\n+++\n\nRemember to include the `[taxonomies]` section header, followed by the\ncategories and tags properties, in your content files. This will ensure that\nyour `tags` and `categories` are displayed and processed as\nexpected.\n      \n    \n  \n\nHmm, where did this \"front matter\" terminology come from?\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhy is that section called \"front matter\" anyhow?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\"Front matter\" is a term that originated in the publishing and printing\nindustry, referring to the initial pages of a book that precede the main\ncontent. These pages usually contain metadata, such as the title, author,\npublication date, and other information about the book.\nIn the context of static site generators and Markdown files, \"front matter\"\nrefers to the metadata block at the beginning of a content file. It contains\ninformation about the content, such as the title, author, date, tags,\ncategories, and other custom properties. This metadata is used by the static\nsite generator to process, organize, and render the content appropriately.\nThe name \"front matter\" is used because this metadata is placed at the\nbeginning (or front) of the content file, similar to the front matter in a\nbook.\n      \n    \n  \n\nSyntax highlighting in vim for these content files would be nice to have...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI'm using vim to edit these files.  How can I check if vim understands how to\ndo syntax highlighting for Markdown and TOML formats?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn Vim, you can check if syntax highlighting for Markdown and TOML formats is\nenabled by opening a file with the appropriate extension (e.g., a `.md`\nfile for Markdown or a `.toml` file for TOML) and then running the\nfollowing command in Vim's command mode:\n:set syntax?\n\nTo enter Vim's command mode, press the ``: key (colon). After entering\nthe command, press Enter. Vim will display the current syntax highlighting\nmode, which should be `markdown` for Markdown files and `toml` for\nTOML files.\nIf Vim does not display the correct syntax highlighting mode or does not\nhighlight the syntax at all, it's possible that Vim does not have the necessary\nsyntax highlighting files or plugins installed. You can add support for\nMarkdown and TOML syntax highlighting by installing the appropriate Vim\nplugins.\nFor Markdown, you can use the\nplasticboy/vim-markdown\nplugin. For TOML, you can use the\ncespare/vim-toml plugin.\nTo install these plugins, you can use a plugin manager like\nVundle or\nvim-plug. Follow the instructions\nprovided by the plugin manager to set it up, and then add the plugins to your\n`.vimrc` file:\nFor Vundle, add the following lines to your `.vimrc`:\nPlugin 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'\nPlugin 'cespare/vim-toml'\n\nFor vim-plug, add the following lines to your `.vimrc`:\nPlug 'plasticboy/vim-markdown'\nPlug 'cespare/vim-toml'\n\nAfter adding these lines, restart Vim and run the appropriate command for your\nplugin manager to install the plugins:\n\nFor Vundle: `:PluginInstall`\nFor vim-plug: `:PlugInstall`\n\nOnce the plugins are installed, Vim should automatically enable syntax\nhighlighting for Markdown and TOML files.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nVim understands Markdown, it doesn't seem to understand TOML.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf Vim doesn't understand TOML syntax highlighting out of the box, you can\ninstall a TOML syntax highlighting plugin, such as\ncespare/vim-toml.\nTo install the `vim-toml` plugin, you can use a plugin manager like\nVundle or\nvim-plug. Follow the instructions\nprovided by the plugin manager to set it up, and then add the plugin to your\n`.vimrc` file.\nFor Vundle, add the following line to your `.vimrc`:\nPlugin 'cespare/vim-toml'\n\nFor vim-plug, add the following line to your `.vimrc`:\nPlug 'cespare/vim-toml'\n\nAfter adding the line, restart Vim and run the appropriate command for your\nplugin manager to install the plugin:\n\nFor Vundle: `:PluginInstall`\nFor vim-plug: `:PlugInstall`\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, Vim should automatically enable syntax\nhighlighting for TOML files.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould I use a plugin manager or install plugins manually?  If I use one, which\nis better, Vundle or vim-plug?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing a plugin manager is generally recommended because it simplifies the\nprocess of installing, updating, and managing plugins. Manually installing\nplugins can be more tedious and difficult to maintain in the long run.\nBoth Vundle and vim-plug are popular Vim plugin managers, and you can choose\neither one based on your preferences. However, vim-plug has some advantages\nover Vundle:\n\n\nFaster: vim-plug installs and updates plugins in parallel, which can save\ntime when managing multiple plugins.\n\n\nLightweight: vim-plug has a smaller codebase, which can result in a faster\nstartup time for Vim.\n\n\nEasier to set up: vim-plug is a single file that you can download and\ninclude in your `.vimrc`, while Vundle requires cloning the repository\nand configuring Vim to load it.\n\n\nGiven these advantages, many users prefer vim-plug over Vundle. To set up\nvim-plug, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n Download the `plug.vim` file and place it in the\n`autoload` directory of your Vim configuration folder (usually\n`~/.vim/autoload/` on Unix systems or\n`%USERPROFILE%\\vimfiles\\autoload\\` on Windows). You can use this\ncommand to download it directly:\ncurl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \\\n    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim\n\n\n Add the following lines to your `.vimrc` to configure vim-plug:\ncall plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')\n\" Add your plugins here, e.g.:\n\" Plug 'cespare/vim-toml'\ncall plug#end()\n\n\n Add plugins by including `Plug` statements between the\n`call plug#begin()` and `call plug#end()` lines in your\n`.vimrc`.\n\n Restart Vim and run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugins.\n\n\nRegardless of which plugin manager you choose, both Vundle and vim-plug will\nmake managing your Vim plugins much easier compared to manual installation.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI had previously manually installed \"AnsiEsc.vim\", which I assume is another\nplugin.  If I install vim-plug, should I have it install \"AnsiEsc.vim\" from\nscratch so it knows about it, or will it figure out what's there by looking in\nthe autoload directory?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nvim-plug won't automatically detect manually installed plugins, like\n\"AnsiEsc.vim\", in the autoload directory. To manage \"AnsiEsc.vim\" using\nvim-plug, you should follow these steps:\n\n\n\n Remove the manually installed \"AnsiEsc.vim\" plugin files from your\nVim configuration. This usually involves deleting the files and directories\nassociated with the plugin from your `~/.vim/` directory (or\n`%USERPROFILE%\\vimfiles\\` on Windows).\n\n Find the GitHub repository or another source for the \"AnsiEsc.vim\"\nplugin. It is available at\nhttps://github.com/powerman/vim-plugin-AnsiEsc.\n\n Add the \"AnsiEsc.vim\" plugin to your `.vimrc` configuration\nfor vim-plug. In your `.vimrc`, between `call\nplug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')` and `call plug#end()`, add the following\nline:\nPlug 'powerman/vim-plugin-AnsiEsc'\n\n\n Save your `.vimrc` and restart Vim.\n\n Run `:PlugInstall` to install the \"AnsiEsc.vim\" plugin using\nvim-plug.\n\n\nNow, vim-plug will manage the \"AnsiEsc.vim\" plugin, making it easier to update\nor remove it in the future.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhat is the ~/.vim/t directory?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe `~/.vim/t` directory is not a standard Vim directory. It could be a\ndirectory created by a specific plugin or by the user for a custom purpose.\nTypically, the standard directories in the `~/.vim` directory are:\n\n`autoload`: Contains autoloaded scripts, which are loaded on-demand\nwhen a function is called.\n`plugin`: Contains plugin scripts that are loaded on Vim startup.\n`ftplugin`: Contains filetype-specific plugin scripts that are loaded\nwhen a specific filetype is detected.\n`syntax`: Contains syntax highlighting scripts for different file\ntypes.\n`indent`: Contains indent scripts for different file types to handle\nindentation rules.\n`colors`: Contains color scheme files for customizing Vim's appearance.\n`doc`: Contains documentation files for various plugins and\ncustomizations.\n`spell`: Contains spelling files for different languages.\n\nIf the `~/.vim/t` directory contains files related to a specific plugin\nor customization, you might find references to it in your `.vimrc` file\nor other Vim configuration files. To determine the purpose of this directory,\nexamine its contents and look for any relevant mentions in your Vim\nconfiguration.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhen I installed \"AnsiEsc\" originally, I think it was packaged as a \"vimball\".\nIs that another plugin manager?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nA \"vimball\" is not a plugin manager, but rather a packaging format for Vim\nplugins. Vimball files (with the `.vba` or `.vmb` extension) are\nself-extracting archives containing the plugin files and a script to install\nthem. This format was popular before plugin managers like Vundle and vim-plug\nbecame widespread.\nTo install a plugin from a vimball, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n\nOpen the vimball file in Vim: vim plugin.vba\n\n\nRun the `:so %` command to source the vimball, which extracts its\ncontents and installs the plugin to the appropriate directories under\n`~/.vim` or another specified location.\n\n\nSave and exit Vim, then restart it to load the newly installed plugin.\n\n\nVimball is not a plugin manager because it does not handle updates or\ndependency management. Its primary function is to facilitate the installation\nprocess of Vim plugins by bundling them into a single file.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSince the Zola content files are a mix of TOML between the +++ lines and\nMarkdown for the rest of the file, has anyone made a Vim syntax highlighting\nmode for this, where it will correctly use TOML highlighting rule between the\n+++ lines and Markdown highlighting rules elsewhere?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there is a Vim plugin called `vim-zola` that provides syntax\nhighlighting for Zola content files, which includes TOML front matter and\nMarkdown content.\nTo install the `vim-zola` plugin using vim-plug, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n Open your `~/.vimrc` file in Vim.\n\n Add the following line to the section where you're configuring your\nplugins:\nPlug 'axvr/vim-zola'\n\n\n Save the ~/.vimrc file and exit Vim.\n\n Run the following command in your terminal to install the plugin:\nvim +PlugInstall +qall\n\n\nAfter installing the `vim-zola` plugin, Vim will correctly apply syntax\nhighlighting to the TOML front matter and the Markdown content in your Zola\ncontent files.\nGitHub repository for reference: https://github.com/axvr/vim-zola\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThat github URL doesn't exist.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for providing an incorrect URL. It seems I made an error in my\nresponse. After further research, I couldn't find a Vim plugin specifically\ndesigned for Zola content files that include both TOML front matter and\nMarkdown content.\nHowever, you can set up a custom solution to achieve syntax highlighting for\nboth TOML and Markdown in Zola content files:\n\n\n\n Install the `vim-polyglot` plugin to get proper TOML and\nMarkdown syntax highlighting. Using vim-plug, add this line to your\n`~/.vimrc` file in the plugin configuration section:\nPlug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'\n\nThen run `vim +PlugInstall +qall` to install the plugin.\n\n Create a custom filetype detection rule for Zola content files:\nCreate a new file `~/.vim/ftdetect/zola.vim` and add the following\ncontent:\nau BufRead,BufNewFile *.md set filetype=zola\n\n\n Create a custom syntax file for Zola content files:\nCreate a new file `~/.vim/after/syntax/zola.vim` and add the\nfollowing content:\nruntime! syntax/toml.vim\nunlet b:current_syntax\nlet b:current_syntax = 'zola'\n\nsyntax include @markdown syntax/markdown.vim\nsyntax region markdownSection start=/\\n\\n+/ end=/\\n\\n+/ contains=@markdown\n\nThis will include both TOML and Markdown syntax highlighting in Zola content\nfiles.\n\n Save and exit Vim.\n\n\nAfter completing these steps, you should have proper syntax highlighting for\nboth TOML front matter and Markdown content in your Zola content files.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWow, this is so bizarre.  ChatGPT gave me these really specific instructions\nfor this URL... which doesn't even exist!  I've read that AI researchers call\nthis \"hallucinations\", where ChatGPT just starts making stuff up and presenting\nit so confidently that it sounds believable.  The moral of the story?\nNever blindly trust ChatGPT to be accurate and correct!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSo you just randomly made up a very specific vim plugin that didn't exist?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. The information\nprovided was incorrect, and I appreciate your understanding.\nThe custom solution I provided in my last response is not a specific Vim plugin\nthat I found. Instead, it is a custom configuration that you can use to achieve\nsyntax highlighting for both TOML front matter and Markdown content in Zola\ncontent files.\nThe steps provided in the previous response will help you set up syntax\nhighlighting for both TOML and Markdown in Zola content files using the\n`vim-polyglot` plugin and some custom configuration files. This is not a\nspecific plugin designed for Zola content files, but rather a workaround that\nyou can use to achieve the desired functionality in Vim.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWhile this \"vim-polyglot\" suggestion might work, it seemed likely that\nsomeone would have already made a Zola syntax highlighting plugin for Vim,\nso I searched Google and found one...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI found this: https://github.com/yorik1984/zola.nvim\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGreat! It seems like you've found a Vim plugin specifically designed for\nworking with Zola projects. The `zola.nvim` plugin offers syntax\nhighlighting and indentation for both TOML front matter and Markdown content in\nZola content files, which is exactly what you were looking for.\nTo install this plugin using vim-plug, add the following line to your\n`.vimrc` file:\nPlug 'yorik1984/zola.nvim'\n\nAfter adding the line, save the `.vimrc` file and then run the following\ncommand in Vim to install the plugin:\n:PlugInstall\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, you should have syntax highlighting and proper\nindentation for both TOML front matter and Markdown content in your Zola\ncontent files.\nRemember to restart Vim or run `:source ~/.vimrc` to ensure the changes\ntake effect.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHere's the README:\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of the README file.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion earlier. It appears that the `zola.nvim`\nplugin is designed for Neovim specifically and not for regular Vim. The plugin\nprovides syntax highlighting for Zola content files that include TOML front\nmatter and Markdown content. It also includes syntax highlighting for Jinja\ntemplates.\nIf you are using Neovim, you can install this plugin with your favorite package\nmanager, as shown in the README. For example, if you are using\n`packer.nvim`, you can add the following to your configuration:\nuse {\n    \"yorik1984/zola.nvim\",\n    requires = {\n        \"Glench/Vim-Jinja2-Syntax\",\n        \"cespare/vim-toml\",             -- for Neovim ⩽ 0.6.0\n    }\n}\n\nHowever, if you are using regular Vim, you might need to look for an\nalternative plugin or create your own custom solution to handle syntax\nhighlighting in Zola content files.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre Neovim plugins incompatible?  And why is it talking about TOML with \"Jinja\"\nsyntax instead of TOML with Markdown?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nNeovim plugins are not always compatible with regular Vim. Neovim has\nintroduced some new features and changes to the Vimscript language, such as the\nuse of Lua for configuration and scripting. Additionally, Neovim plugins may\nrely on Neovim-specific APIs or features that are not available in regular Vim.\nThe `zola.nvim` plugin mentions \"Jinja\" syntax because Zola uses the\nJinja2 templating engine for rendering HTML templates. The plugin provides\nsyntax highlighting for Jinja templates in addition to highlighting TOML front\nmatter in Markdown files. The Jinja syntax highlighting is relevant for Zola's\nHTML template files, not for the content files that mix TOML and Markdown.\nIn summary, the `zola.nvim` plugin appears to be designed for Neovim and\nmight not be compatible with regular Vim. While it does provide syntax\nhighlighting for TOML front matter in Markdown files, it also includes Jinja\nsyntax highlighting for Zola's HTML templates. You can try to find an\nalternative plugin for Vim or create your own custom solution for handling\nsyntax highlighting in Zola content files.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI added these plugins and it seems to be working:\nPlug 'Glench/Vim-Jinja2-Syntax'\nPlug 'yorik1984/zola.nvim'\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGreat! It looks like you have successfully installed the\n`Vim-Jinja2-Syntax` and `zola.nvim` plugins using vim-plug. These\nplugins should provide syntax highlighting for Jinja2 templates and Zola\ncontent files, respectively.\nNow that you have installed the plugins, you should be able to work on your\nZola content files with improved syntax highlighting for TOML front matter and\nMarkdown.\nIf you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy\nediting!\n      \n    \n  \n\nLooks like I got lucky with this one; this plugin says it's specifically for\nNeovim, but it does seem to work fine with standard Vim as well.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf the frontmatter contains \"date\" and \"slug\" explicitly, can the \"path\" then\nbe specified below those by reference to variables as a fixed string, to\nemulate the WordPress URL format?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can use the `slug` and `date` variables in the\n`path` field of the front matter to create a custom URL structure similar\nto WordPress. Zola allows you to use variables in the `path` field by\nwrapping them in curly braces `{}`. For example, you can use the\nfollowing front matter to create a WordPress-like URL format with the year,\nmonth, day, and slug:\n+++\ntitle = \"Example Post\"\ndate = 2023-03-28\nslug = \"example-post\"\n\n[path]\ntemplate = \"/{year}/{month}/{day}/{slug}/\"\n+++\n\nThis would generate a URL like `/2023/03/28/example-post/`.\nKeep in mind that you'll need to add the `path` section with the\n`template` field in every content file for which you want to apply the\ncustom URL format. Alternatively, you can set the path template globally in the\n`config.toml` file, so you don't need to specify it in each content file:\n# config.toml\n[extra]\npath_template = \"/{year}/{month}/{day}/{slug}/\"\n\nThen, in your content files:\n+++\ntitle = \"Example Post\"\ndate = 2023-03-28\nslug = \"example-post\"\npath = { template = \"extra.path_template\" }\n+++\n\nThis way, you can reuse the path template across all your content files.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis technique seems like a bit of a hassle.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs it possible to specify, say, \"path.template = ...\" instead of using the\n[path] section?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUnfortunately, Zola does not support specifying the path template in a single\nline like `path.template = ...` in the front matter. You have to use the\n`[path]` section to define the `template` field as shown in the\nprevious examples.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI can avoid that section by using \"path = whatever\" in the initial default\nsection of the frontmatter?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion earlier. In Zola, you cannot set the `path`\ndirectly in the front matter. You must use the `[extra]` or\n`[path]` sections. The correct approach to set the path is by using the\n`[path]` section with a `template` field as shown in the previous\nexamples.\nHere's a quick recap:\n+++\ntitle = \"Your Post Title\"\ndate = 2023-04-01\nslug = \"your-post-slug\"\n\n[path]\ntemplate = \"/blog/{year}/{month}/{day}/{slug}/\"\n+++\n\nThe above configuration sets a custom path template for the specific post.\n      \n    \n  \n\nChatGPT isn't always right, and it seemed likely to work, so I tested setting\nthe path directly in the front matter, even though ChatGPT said it cannot be\ndone that way.  Lo and behold, it does work!  It requires some redundancy,\nbut this approach seems like ths best option...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThis seems to be working:\n+++\ntitle = \"Welcome to CodeReflections!\"\ndate = 2023-04-17\nslug = \"welcome-to-codereflections\"\npath = \"/2023/04/17/welcome-to-codereflections/\"\n\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"Meta\"]\ntags = [\"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, that's a valid configuration for your front matter. You've set the\n`title`, `date`, `slug`, and `path` explicitly, and\nyou've also specified the categories and tags for the post.\nWith this configuration, your post will be accessible at the URL:\n`/2023/04/17/welcome-to-codereflections/`, and it will have the category\n\"Meta\" and the tag \"ChatGPT\".\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhen I tried the [path] section, it gave me this error:\n-&gt; Content changed /home/deven/git/codereflections/content/welcome-to-codereflections.md\nError: Failed to build the site\nError: Error when parsing front matter of section `/home/deven/git/codereflections/content/welcome-to-codereflections.md`\nError: Reason: TOML parse error at line 5, column 1\n  |\n5 | [path]\n  | ^^^^^^\ninvalid type: map, expected a string\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion earlier. It appears that specifying the\n`[path]` section in the front matter is not supported. You should use the\n`path` key directly in the front matter, as you have done in the previous\nexample:\n+++\ntitle = \"Welcome to CodeReflections!\"\ndate = 2023-04-17\nslug = \"welcome-to-codereflections\"\npath = \"/2023/04/17/welcome-to-codereflections/\"\n\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"Meta\"]\ntags = [\"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\nThis configuration is correct and should work as expected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt's a nuisance to have to specify the path explicitly like that when the\nentire thing could be generated by a template, but based on those tickets the\nZola developer was resisting, who knows when or if that will ever work.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, I understand your concern. While the current implementation in Zola may\nnot be as flexible as desired, specifying the path directly in the front matter\nis the current recommended approach. It is always possible that the Zola\ndevelopers may introduce more flexible options in the future based on user\nfeedback.\nFor now, you can continue using the explicit path specification as a\nworkaround. Alternatively, you may consider exploring other static site\ngenerators that might better suit your needs in terms of URL generation.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I create future posts without them going live early?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can create future posts in Zola without them going live early. When\nyou create a new post, set the `date` field in the front matter to a\nfuture date. By default, Zola will not build and display posts with a future\ndate.\nIf you want to build the site with future posts included (e.g., for testing),\nyou can use the `--drafts` flag when building the site:\nzola build --drafts\n\nThis will include all drafts and future-dated posts in the output. Just make\nsure not to use the `--drafts` flag when building the site for production\ndeployment.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nBuilding it again without --drafts will delete the draft one?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, when you build the site again without the `--drafts` flag, Zola will\nnot include the draft or future-dated posts in the output. Any previously\ngenerated draft or future-dated posts from an earlier build with the\n`--drafts` flag will be removed from the `public` folder (or your\ncustom output folder) during the new build process.\nSo, you don't need to worry about accidentally deploying drafts or future-dated\nposts when building the site without the `--drafts` flag.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis seems to be a good stopping point for now.  In my next post, I will\ncontinue with the next part of my ChatGPT conversation, which was about how to\nnicely format sections of the ChatGPT conversation itself to incorporate them\ninto these blog posts.  As it turned out, it required research and\nexperimentation, as well as jumping through a few hoops!\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/05/13/fine-tuning-the-website-theme/","title":"Fine-tuning the website theme."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/06/23/formatting-chatgpt-conversations/":{"body":"Oops!  It's been over a month since my last\npost about fine-tuning the website\ntheme.  I've been expecting this from the start, that sooner or later I'd fall\nbehind on making new blog posts because of being busy and distracted by\neveryday life.  Oh well.  (I'll try not to fall so far behind again, but I'm\nsure it will happen again, probably sooner than later!)\nI've also been procrastinating on this post because formatting these ChatGPT\nconversations is a rather tedious process.  That procrastination contributed to\nthe long delay since my last post.  Actually, figuring out how to format\nChatGPT conversations is the topic of this post...\n\nI wanted to be able to quote parts of my conversations with ChatGPT in these\nblog posts, but I did want them to be nicely formatted.  This turned out to be\nmore challenging than expected.  I did eventually come up with an acceptable\nsolution to this issue, but it remains a slow, painstaking process to render\nthese ChatGPT conversations.  Surely there must be a better way?\nUnfortunately, I can't just copy &amp; paste the conversation from the ChatGPT web\npage into these Markdown content files and get a decent result.  If I try to\ncopy &amp; paste the raw HTML, the result looks terrible and the content file\nbecomes unmaintainable anyhow.  Instead, I have to paste the conversation as\nplain text, losing all of the original formatting in the process.\nAfter that, I have to compare the original ChatGPT web page side-by-side with\nthe rendered blog post and fix a myriad of formatting issues, adding the\nstructural code to show the conversation in a box with the avatar images,\ninserting hyperlinks, adding bold highlighting and backquotes, recreating code\nblocks, escaping various metacharacters as necessary, fixing edge cases, etc.\nThis isn't a perfect reproduction of the way the conversations are actually\nrendered on the ChatGPT website, but by the time I'm done fixing all the\nformatting issues, the end result is a pretty good approximation.  I haven't\ntried to match the fonts and colors but the overall formatting is similar.\nTo illustrate this, here is a screen capture (without the sidebar) from the\nChatGPT website showing the first part of the\nconversation quoted below, as it was actually rendered:\n\nCompare the screen capture above with the rendered conversation below, then\ncontinue reading the conversation as I start in on the topic of how to do this\nin the first place!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf I'm posting about my conversations with you, what's the best way to copy &amp;\npaste parts of our conversation and format them nicely with Markdown?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen copying and pasting parts of your conversations with me into a Markdown\nfile, you can use a combination of blockquotes and code blocks to format the\nconversation nicely.\n1. Blockquotes: Use `&gt;` at the beginning of each line to create a\nblockquote.  This is useful for quoting text from our conversation.\nFor example:\n&gt; User: What is the capital of France?\n&gt; Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nThis will render as:\n\n\"User: What is the capital of France?\nAssistant: The capital of France is Paris.\"\n\n1. Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) to create a code block. This is\nuseful for preserving the original formatting of the conversation, including\nline breaks.\nFor example:\n&lt;pre&gt;\n```\nUser: What is the capital of France?\nAssistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n&lt;/pre&gt;\nThis will render as:\nUser: What is the capital of France?\nAssistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n\nChoose the formatting style that best fits the context and style of your post.\nYou can also use other Markdown formatting options, like bold or italic text,\nto emphasize parts of the conversation as needed.\n      \n    \n  \n\n(Yes, ChatGPT numbered both \"Blockquote\" and \"Code blocks\" as \"1.\"  Go figure.)\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow hard would it be to add the avatar images to each message block as shown on\nchat.openai.com?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo add avatar images to each message block, you'll need to modify your Zola\ntheme's CSS and HTML templates. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n1.\nFirst, download or create the avatar images you want to use for the user and\nthe assistant. Save them in your theme's `static` directory, for example,\n`static/user-avatar.png` and `static/assistant-avatar.png`.\n2.\nNext, modify your theme's CSS file to add styles for the message blocks and\navatar images. Add the following CSS classes in your theme's CSS file:\n.message-block {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n  margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n\n.avatar {\n  width: 40px;\n  height: 40px;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n}\n\n.user-message .avatar {\n  background-image: url('/user-avatar.png');\n  background-size: cover;\n}\n\n.assistant-message .avatar {\n  background-image: url('/assistant-avatar.png');\n  background-size: cover;\n}\n\n.message-content {\n  max-width: 80%;\n}\n\n1. In your Zola content Markdown file, wrap each message in a\n`div` element with the appropriate classes. For example:\n&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      User: What is the capital of France?\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block assistant-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nYou can adjust the CSS properties to change the size of the avatar images, the\nspacing between elements, or any other styling preferences you may have.\nThis is a simple example and can be further customized to fit your desired\ndesign.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nYour avatar image is implemented as &lt;svg&gt;\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf you want to use an SVG image for the avatar, you can directly include the\nSVG code in your HTML template.\nHere's an example of how to do it:\n1. Modify your theme's CSS file to remove the background-image\nproperties from the `.user-message .avatar` and `.assistant-message\n.avatar` classes:\n.user-message .avatar {\n  /* Remove background-image property */\n}\n\n.assistant-message .avatar {\n  /* Remove background-image property */\n}\n\n1. In your Zola content Markdown file, replace the `div`\nelement for the avatar with the SVG code. For example:\n&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- User avatar SVG code goes here --&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      User: What is the capital of France?\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block assistant-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Assistant avatar SVG code goes here --&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nYou can find the SVG code for the avatars in the chat.openai.com page source or\ncreate your own SVG images. Make sure to adjust the size and other properties\nof the SVG elements to fit the design you have in mind.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nMy avatar isn't SVG, of course.  It's a WEBP image.  Yours is SVG.  Can I put\nthe SVG code into an external HTML file and include it with a Zola directive?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can put the SVG code into an external HTML file and include it using\nthe `include` directive in Zola. Here's how to do it:\n1.\nCreate an `_includes` directory inside your theme's `templates`\ndirectory if it doesn't already exist. The path should be something like\n`themes/your-theme/templates/_includes/`.\n2.\nCreate an HTML file with the SVG code for the avatar inside the\n`_includes` directory. For example, name it `assistant_avatar.html`\nand add the SVG code for the assistant avatar.\n3.\nIn your Zola content Markdown file, use the `include` directive to\ninclude the SVG code in the avatar `div`. For example:\n&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"path/to/your-avatar.webp\" alt=\"User Avatar\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      User: What is the capital of France?\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block assistant-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    {% include \"assistant_avatar.html\" %}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nMake sure to replace `path/to/your-avatar.webp` with the actual path to\nyour WEBP avatar image.\nBy using the `include` directive, Zola will include the content of the\n`assistant_avatar.html` file in the specified location when rendering the\ntemplate.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSince the DeepThought theme comes from another repository, can I create\n\"includes\" or \"_includes\" at the top level of my site's directory structure,\nwhere the \"content\", \"themes\" and \"templates\" directories are?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can create an `_includes` directory at the top level of your\nsite's directory structure, alongside the `content`, `themes`, and\n`templates` directories. Zola will look for includes in both your site's\ntop-level `_includes` directory and the theme's `_includes`\ndirectory.\nTo create an `_includes` directory at the top level of your site:\n1.\nIn your site's root directory, create a new directory called `_includes`.\n2.\nMove the `assistant_avatar.html` file (or create a new one) inside the\nnewly created `_includes` directory.\n3.\nIn your Zola content Markdown file, use the `include` directive to\ninclude the SVG code in the avatar `div`:\n&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"path/to/your-avatar.webp\" alt=\"User Avatar\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      User: What is the capital of France?\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block assistant-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    {% include \"assistant_avatar.html\" %}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nZola will first look for the `assistant_avatar.html` file in your site's\ntop-level `_includes` directory and then in the theme's `_includes`\ndirectory. If it finds the file in either location, it will include the content\nof the file in the specified location when rendering the template.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis all sounds good, but of course it didn't actually work.  ChatGPT can be\nhelpful and informative one moment, and lead you astray the next.  Beware!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe {% include \"assistant_avatar.html\" %} is just being rendered as HTML text.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion. In Zola, to include an HTML file, you'll need to\nuse the `load_data` function and then output the loaded data as safe\nHTML.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n1. In the content Markdown file, use the `load_data`\nfunction to load the `assistant_avatar.html` file:\n{% set assistant_avatar = load_data(path=\"_includes/assistant_avatar.html\") %}\n\n1. Use the `safe` filter to output the loaded data as safe\nHTML in the avatar `div`:\n&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"path/to/your-avatar.webp\" alt=\"User Avatar\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      User: What is the capital of France?\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block assistant-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    {{ assistant_avatar | safe }}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nWith these changes, Zola should include the SVG code from the\n`assistant_avatar.html` file in the rendered output, and you should see\nthe avatars as expected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhere in the file should I put the {% set ... %} directive?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou should place the `{% set ... %}` directive at the beginning of your\ncontent Markdown file, before the opening `+++`. This way, Zola will load\nthe data before processing the rest of the content. Here's an example:\n{% set assistant_avatar = load_data(path=\"_includes/assistant_avatar.html\") %}\n\n+++\ntitle = \"My Conversation with ChatGPT\"\ndate = 2023-04-18\nslug = \"conversation-with-chatgpt\"\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"AI\"]\ntags = [\"OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\nIn this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"path/to/your-avatar.webp\" alt=\"User Avatar\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      User: What is the capital of France?\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block assistant-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n    {{ assistant_avatar | safe }}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;\n      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.\n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThis will ensure that the `assistant_avatar` variable is set and\navailable for use in the rest of the content.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOf course, this didn't work either!  ChatGPT's hallucinations continue...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBuilding site...\nError: Failed to serve the site\nError: Couldn't find front matter in\n`/home/deven/git/codereflections/content/20230419-whats-in-a-name.md`.

It seems that Zola does not support setting\nvariables outside of the front matter. You can try the following workaround:\n1. Create a new file called `avatars.toml` in your\n`content` directory:\nassistant_avatar = \"\"\"\n&lt;!-- Paste your SVG code here --&gt;\n\"\"\"\n\n1. In your content file, load this data file and then use the\n`assistant_avatar` variable:\n+++\ntitle = \"My Conversation with ChatGPT\"\ndate = 2023-04-18\nslug = \"conversation-with-chatgpt\"\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"AI\"]\ntags = [\"OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\n{% set avatars = load_data(path=\"avatars.toml\") %}\n{% set assistant_avatar = avatars.assistant_avatar %}\n\nIn this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.\n\n&lt;!-- Add your message blocks here, using assistant_avatar --&gt;\n\nThis should allow you to load the SVG data without encountering issues with the\nfront matter.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI didn't try the TOML file yet because I'm also seeing {{ chatgpt_avatar | safe\n}} rendered as HTML text.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nMy apologies for the confusion. Since the content is being rendered as HTML\ntext, it seems that the `safe` filter is not working as expected.\nPlease try this alternative approach:\n1. Create a file called `avatar_macros.html` in your\n`templates` directory:\n{% macro render_assistant_avatar() %}\n  &lt;!-- Paste your SVG code here --&gt;\n{% endmacro %}\n\n{% macro render_user_avatar() %}\n  &lt;img src=\"path/to/your/webp/image\" alt=\"User avatar\" /&gt;\n{% endmacro %}\n\n1. In your content file, import the macros and use them to render\nthe avatars:\njinja2\nCopy code\n+++\ntitle = \"My Conversation with ChatGPT\"\ndate = 2023-04-18\nslug = \"conversation-with-chatgpt\"\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"AI\"]\ntags = [\"OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\n{% import \"avatar_macros.html\" as avatar_macros %}\n\nIn this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.\n\n&lt;!-- Add your message blocks here, using avatar_macros.render_assistant_avatar() and avatar_macros.render_user_avatar() --&gt;\n\nWith this approach, you won't need to use the `safe` filter. The macros\nwill be called directly in the content and should render the SVG and image\nelements correctly.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI just tried asking the GPT-3.5 default model, in a new conversation, \"Using\nZola, how can I have my content Markdown file include a block of HTML from\nanother file?\"  This was the response:\nTo include a block of HTML from another file in your Markdown content using\nZola, you can use Zola's built-in shortcodes feature.\nHere's an example of how to use a shortcode to include HTML from another file:\nCreate a new file in your Zola project's templates/shortcodes directory, e.g.\ninclude.html.\nIn the include.html file, add the HTML code you want to include, wrapped in a\ndiv or other appropriate container element.\nIn your Markdown content file, add a shortcode to include the HTML code from\ninclude.html. The shortcode syntax is {% shortcode_name \"file_path\" %}, where\nshortcode_name is the name you want to give the shortcode (e.g. include_html),\nand file_path is the path to the file containing the HTML code you want to\ninclude, relative to the root of your Zola project.\nFor example, let's say you have a file called header.html in your Zola\nproject's templates directory that contains the HTML code for your website's\nheader:\nhtml\nCopy code\n&lt;div class=\"header\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;My Website&lt;/h1&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;nav&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ul&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/about\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/contact\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nTo include this header HTML in your Markdown content file, you could create a\nshortcode like this:\nCreate a new file called header.html in the templates/shortcodes directory.\nIn the header.html file, add the following code:\nhtml\nCopy code\n{% with file_path = \"templates/header.html\" %}\n{% include file_path %}\n{% endwith %}\nIn your Markdown content file, add the shortcode {% include_html \"header.html\"\n%} where you want to include the header HTML.\nWhen Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the\ncontents of header.html, so the resulting HTML output will include your header.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt appears that the response you received describes using Zola's shortcodes\nfeature to include a block of HTML from another file.\nTo use this method, please follow these steps:\n1.\nCreate a new directory named `shortcodes` inside your project's\n`templates` directory.\n2.\nCreate a new file called `include_html.html` inside the\n`templates/shortcodes` directory, and add the following code:\n{% with file_path = args.path %}\n  {% include file_path %}\n{% endwith %}\n\n1. In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode `{%\ninclude_html path=\"path/to/your/file.html\" %}` where you want to include the\nHTML. Replace `path/to/your/file.html` with the path to the HTML file you\nwant to include, relative to your Zola project's root.\nFor example, if you have an HTML file called `assistant_avatar.html` in\nthe `templates/includes` directory, you can include it in your Markdown\ncontent file like this:\n+++\ntitle = \"My Conversation with ChatGPT\"\ndate = 2023-04-18\nslug = \"conversation-with-chatgpt\"\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"AI\"]\ntags = [\"OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\nIn this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.\n\n{% include_html path=\"templates/includes/assistant_avatar.html\" %}\n\nWhen Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the\ncontents of the specified HTML file.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I was getting pretty tired of ChatGPT leading me into dead ends\nwith this, so I took the time to read through Zola's \"shortcodes\" documentation\nmyself, and quickly found that ChatGPT's instructions were wrong yet again.\nI decided to call the documentation to ChatGPT's attention to see whether or\nnot it would improve its answer.  I knew that ChatGPT wouldn't fetch the URL,\nbut the URL might have been included in its training data.  I figured that\nidentifying the relevant URL might direct ChatGPT in the right direction...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nReference https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/ and tell me\nif you need to change your recommendation.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion earlier. Based on the official Zola documentation,\nmy previous recommendation was incorrect. Here's the correct method for\nincluding an HTML file using shortcodes:\n1.\nCreate a new directory named `shortcodes` inside your project's\n`templates` directory.\n2.\nCreate a new file called `include_html.html` inside the\n`templates/shortcodes` directory, and add the following code:\n{% include args.file_path %}\n\n1. In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode `{%\ninclude_html file_path=\"path/to/your/file.html\" %}` where you want to\ninclude the HTML. Replace `path/to/your/file.html` with the path to the\nHTML file you want to include, relative to your Zola project's root.\nFor example, if you have an HTML file called `assistant_avatar.html` in\nthe `templates/includes` directory, you can include it in your Markdown\ncontent file like this:\n+++\ntitle = \"My Conversation with ChatGPT\"\ndate = 2023-04-18\nslug = \"conversation-with-chatgpt\"\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"AI\"]\ntags = [\"OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\nIn this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.\n\n{% include_html file_path=\"templates/includes/assistant_avatar.html\" %}\n\nWhen Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the\ncontents of the specified HTML file.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIn this case, shouldn't I just create a \"chatgpt_avatar\" shortcode with the SVG\ncode?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can directly create a `chatgpt_avatar` shortcode with the SVG\ncode. Here's how you can do it:\n1.\nCreate a new directory named `shortcodes` inside your project's\n`templates` directory if it doesn't already exist.\n2.\nCreate a new file called `chatgpt_avatar.html` inside the\n`templates/shortcodes` directory, and add the SVG code for the ChatGPT\navatar:\n&lt;!-- Paste the ChatGPT SVG code here --&gt;\n\n1. In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode `{%\nchatgpt_avatar %}` where you want to include the ChatGPT avatar. For\nexample:\n+++\ntitle = \"My Conversation with ChatGPT\"\ndate = 2023-04-18\nslug = \"conversation-with-chatgpt\"\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"AI\"]\ntags = [\"OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\nIn this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.\n\n{% chatgpt_avatar %}\n\nWhen Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the\ncontents of the `chatgpt_avatar.html` file, which contains the ChatGPT\navatar SVG code.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAgain, having read through the documentation, I knew ChatGPT's instructions\nwere still wrong, so I decided to provide the content of that documentation so\nthat it could respond more appropriately.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAre you sure about that?  Here's the content of that Zola shortcodes\ndocumentation:\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of the documentation page.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. You're correct. Based on the Zola documentation,\nwe should create a shortcode using a different approach. Here's the updated\nmethod:\n1.\nCreate a new directory named `shortcodes` inside your project's\n`templates` directory if it doesn't already exist.\n2.\nCreate a new file called `chatgpt_avatar.html` inside the\n`templates/shortcodes` directory, and add the SVG code for the ChatGPT\navatar:\n&lt;!-- Paste the ChatGPT SVG code here --&gt;\n\n1. In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode `{{\nchatgpt_avatar() }}` where you want to include the ChatGPT avatar. For\nexample:\n+++\ntitle = \"My Conversation with ChatGPT\"\ndate = 2023-04-18\nslug = \"conversation-with-chatgpt\"\n[taxonomies]\ncategories = [\"AI\"]\ntags = [\"OpenAI\", \"ChatGPT\"]\n+++\n\nIn this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.\n\n{{ chatgpt_avatar() }}\n\nWhen Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the\ncontents of the `chatgpt_avatar.html` file, which contains the ChatGPT\navatar SVG code.\n      \n    \n  \n\nFinally!  I had to quote the documentation to ChatGPT, but at least this time\nthe instructions were actually valid.  (It was a hassle to format the above\nChatGPT response for this post because Zola was trying to expand the\n\"chatgpt_avatar\" shortcode in the code block!  I had to work around the problem\nusing HTML directly.)\nI decided to press ChatGPT a bit on why providing the content of the\ndocumentation was necessary, although I didn't really expect much from this\nquestion...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThat worked finally.  Why didn't you get the right answer the first time, or\nwhen I specifically referenced the Zola documentation link, which was clearly\nin your training data?  Why did I need to copy and paste the content of that\npage instead?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion and inconvenience caused by my initial response.\nAs an AI language model, I strive to provide the most accurate and helpful\ninformation based on the context of the conversation. However, I'm not perfect\nand can sometimes misunderstand the context or provide less than optimal\nsolutions.\nWhen you provided the Zola documentation link, I should have recognized the\nproper solution based on your request. It's possible that I didn't fully\nunderstand your context or intent, which led to the less accurate response.\nWhen you pasted the content of the documentation, it provided more context and\ninformation, which helped me understand better and provide the correct\nsolution.\nAgain, I apologize for the confusion, and I appreciate your patience in working\nwith me to find the correct solution.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, so I've got a way to insert the ChatGPT avatar SVG image using a Zola\nshortcode.  Now I need to figure out the CSS details...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhere should I put the new CSS rules?  Should that be in the \"static/css\"\ndirectory?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, the best place to put your new CSS rules would be in the\n`static/css` directory. You can either create a new CSS file for your\ncustom styles or add the rules to an existing CSS file if one is provided by\nthe theme.\nIf you create a new CSS file, you'll also need to make sure it's included in\nyour site's templates. To do this, open the `base.html` file (or a\nsimilar file, depending on your theme's structure) in the `templates`\ndirectory of your theme, and add a link to your new CSS file within the\n`&lt;head&gt;` section:\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ get_url(path='/css/your_new_css_file.css') }}\"&gt;\n\nReplace `your_new_css_file.css` with the name of the CSS file you\ncreated. This will ensure that your new CSS rules are applied to your site.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nOkay, I'll create \"static/css/chatgpt.css\" for this.  But what is the point of\nusing the get_url() instead of just using href=\"/css/chatgpt.css\"?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're right that using a direct path like `href=\"/css/chatgpt.css\"` can\nwork in many cases. However, using the `get_url()` function in Zola\nprovides some benefits:\n1.\nURL generation: Zola handles generating the correct URLs for you, taking into\naccount any changes to the base URL or the site structure. This can be\nespecially helpful when deploying your site to different environments, such as\nstaging or production, where the base URL might differ.\n2.\nURL normalization: `get_url()` normalizes the URLs, ensuring that they\nare properly formatted and do not contain any issues that might cause broken\nlinks or unexpected behavior.\n3.\nFuture-proofing: By using `get_url()`, you ensure that your code remains\ncompatible with future changes to Zola or your site structure, as the function\nwill continue to generate correct URLs even if the internal handling changes.\nIn summary, using `get_url()` is a good practice because it helps\nmaintain the consistency and robustness of your site's URLs. It makes your code\nmore maintainable and future-proof.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI had a typo in the word \"defined\" in my next question, but ChatGPT understood\nwithout skipping a beat...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe SVG code is defiend with width=\"41\" and height=\"41\".  How do I resize this\nto 32x32?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou can easily resize the SVG by updating the `width` and `height`\nattributes in the SVG code. To change the dimensions to 32x32, modify the\nattributes like this:\n&lt;svg width=\"32\" height=\"32\" ...&gt;\n\nKeep in mind that if the aspect ratio of the original SVG is not 1:1, the image\nmight appear slightly distorted when resized to 32x32. In this case, the\noriginal dimensions are 41x41, which is a 1:1 aspect ratio, so you shouldn't\nhave any issues resizing it to 32x32.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nChanging the width and height like that won't affect the coordinates in the SVG\ncode?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct. If the SVG contains absolute coordinates, changing the width\nand height attributes might not scale the entire image as expected. In that\ncase, you can use the `viewBox` attribute to control the scaling\nproperly.\nIf your SVG doesn't already have a `viewBox` attribute, you can add it\nlike this:\n&lt;svg width=\"32\" height=\"32\" viewBox=\"0 0 41 41\" ...&gt;\n\nHere, the `viewBox` attribute is set to `0 0 41 41`, which means\nthat the original dimensions of the SVG are 41x41. By setting the width and\nheight attributes to 32, the SVG will be scaled down proportionally to fit\nwithin a 32x32 box while maintaining its aspect ratio.\nIf your SVG already has a `viewBox` attribute, you can just update the\nwidth and height attributes to 32x32, and the SVG should scale proportionally.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAh, it already had viewBox=\"0 0 41 41\".  Good.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGreat! Since the viewBox attribute is already set to \"0 0 41 41\", you can\nsimply change the width and height attributes to 32x32, and the SVG will scale\ndown proportionally while maintaining its aspect ratio.\nHere's the updated SVG code:\n&lt;svg width=\"32\" height=\"32\" viewBox=\"0 0 41 41\" ...&gt;\n\nNow the SVG should display at the desired size of 32x32 pixels.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThat worked fine.  Here's one of the original CSS rules you gave me:\n.assistant-message .avatar {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/assistant-avatar.png');\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;\n}\nFirst, should this be using the Zola get_url() also?  Also, how do I change\nthis to use the SVG code?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSince the CSS file is a static asset and not processed by Zola, there's no need\nto use `get_url()` in this case. You can continue to use the relative\npath to the CSS file in the `href` attribute.\nTo change the CSS rule to use the SVG code, you can use an inline SVG as a\nbackground image by encoding it as a data URI. Here's how to do it:\n\n\nRemove the line `background-image: url('/assistant-avatar.png');` from\nyour CSS rule.\n\n\nGo to an SVG-to-data-URI converter tool, such as this\none.\n\n\nPaste your entire SVG code into the converter tool.\n\n\nCopy the resulting data URI from the tool.\n\n\nAdd the data URI as the `background-image` in your CSS rule:\n\n\n.assistant-message .avatar {\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');\n  background-size: cover;\n}\n\nReplace the `...` in the `url()` with the actual data URI you got\nfrom the converter tool.\nThis way, the CSS rule will use the inline SVG code as the background image for\nthe `.assistant-message .avatar` class.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I simplify this example by using CSS to insert the div for the avatars?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can simplify the example by using the `::before` pseudo-element\nin your CSS to insert the avatar without having to add an extra `div` in\nyour HTML. Here's how you can modify the CSS:\n.assistant-message::before,\n.user-message::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  margin-right: 8px;\n  background-size: cover;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n}\n\n.assistant-message::before {\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');\n}\n\nReplace the `...` in the `url()` with the actual data URI you got\nfrom the converter tool.\nNow you can remove the avatar `div` from your HTML:\n&lt;div class=\"assistant-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Assistant: Hi, how can I help you today?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nWith this approach, the avatar will be automatically inserted before each\nmessage with the `.assistant-message` class, and you don't need to\ninclude the extra `div` for the avatar in your HTML.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhat does \"background-size: cover\" mean?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n`background-size: cover` is a CSS property that controls the size of a\nbackground image in an element. The `cover` value specifies that the\nbackground image should be scaled proportionally to completely cover the\ncontent area of the element. In other words, the image will be resized so that\nit is at least as large as the element's width or height, whichever is greater.\nThis might result in the image being cropped if its aspect ratio doesn't match\nthe element's aspect ratio. The main goal of using `background-size:\ncover` is to ensure that the background image always covers the entire\nelement, regardless of the element's size or the image's aspect ratio.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI feel like I have more rules than I need here:\n.message-block {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: flex-start;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n.avatar {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1rem;\n}\n.user-message .avatar {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;\n}\n.chatgpt-message .avatar {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/chatgpt-avatar.png');\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;\n}\n.message-content {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 80%;\n}\n.chatgpt-message::before,\n.user-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;content: \"\";\n&nbsp;&nbsp;display: inline-block;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 8px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: middle;\n}\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt seems that you have some redundant styles. Here's a simplified version of your CSS:\n.message-block {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n  margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n\n.avatar {\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n  background-size: cover;\n}\n\n.user-message .avatar {\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n}\n\n.chatgpt-message .avatar {\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');\n}\n\n.message-content {\n  max-width: 80%;\n}\n\nIn this simplified version, I removed the redundant styles for `::before`\npseudoelements and directly set the background-image for the\n`.chatgpt-message .avatar` and `.user-message .avatar` classes. The\n`background-size: cover;` style has been moved to the `.avatar`\nclass, as it is common to both avatars.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHow are the ::before elements redundant?  I thought the whole point of them was\nnot to need a second div in the content?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion. You are correct that the `::before`\npseudoelements can be used to avoid having a second div in the content. I\nmisunderstood your intention in the previous response. If you would like to use\nthe `::before` pseudoelements, you can update your CSS like this:\n.message-block {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n  margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n\n.message-content {\n  max-width: 80%;\n}\n\n.chatgpt-message::before,\n.user-message::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  margin-right: 8px;\n  background-size: cover;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n}\n\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');\n}\n\n.user-message::before {\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n}\n\nWith this CSS, you won't need the extra `.avatar` div in your content.\nThe avatars will be generated using the `::before` pseudoelements for\nboth `.chatgpt-message` and `.user-message` elements.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhich is better for the \"margin-right\"?  \"8px\" or \"1rem\"?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBoth \"8px\" and \"1rem\" can be used for the \"margin-right,\" but they serve\nslightly different purposes.\nUsing \"8px\" sets a fixed margin of 8 pixels between the elements, which will\nremain the same regardless of the font size or zoom level.\nUsing \"1rem,\" on the other hand, sets a margin relative to the root element's\nfont size. If the root font size is set to 16 pixels (which is the default for\nmost browsers), then \"1rem\" will be equivalent to 16 pixels. However, if the\nuser changes the font size or zooms in/out on the webpage, the margin will\nadjust accordingly.\nIn general, using \"1rem\" is preferred in responsive designs because it allows\nfor better adaptability to different devices and user settings. If you want a\nfixed margin that doesn't change with the font size, you can use \"8px.\"\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould this work?\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml,M37.5324 16.8707C37.9808\n15.5241 38.1363 14.0974 37.9886 12.6859C37.8409 11.2744 37.3934 9.91076 36.676\n8.68622C35.6126 6.83404 33.9882 5.3676 32.0373 4.4985C30.0864 3.62941 27.9098\n3.40259 25.8215 3.85078C24.8796 2.7893 23.7219 1.94125 22.4257 1.36341C21.1295\n0.785575 19.7249 0.491269 18.3058 0.500197C16.1708 0.495044 14.0893 1.16803\n12.3614 2.42214C10.6335 3.67624 9.34853 5.44666 8.6917 7.47815C7.30085 7.76286\n5.98686 8.3414 4.8377 9.17505C3.68854 10.0087 2.73073 11.0782 2.02839\n12.312C0.956464 14.1591 0.498905 16.2988 0.721698 18.4228C0.944492 20.5467\n1.83612 22.5449 3.268 24.1293C2.81966 25.4759 2.66413 26.9026 2.81182\n28.3141C2.95951 29.7256 3.40701 31.0892 4.12437 32.3138C5.18791 34.1659 6.8123\n35.6322 8.76321 36.5013C10.7141 37.3704 12.8907 37.5973 14.9789 37.1492C15.9208\n38.2107 17.0786 39.0587 18.3747 39.6366C19.6709 40.2144 21.0755 40.5087 22.4946\n40.4998C24.6307 40.5054 26.7133 39.8321 28.4418 38.5772C30.1704 37.3223 31.4556\n35.5506 32.1119 33.5179C33.5027 33.2332 34.8167 32.6547 35.9659 31.821C37.115\n30.9874 38.0728 29.9178 38.7752 28.684C39.8458 26.8371 40.3023 24.6979 40.0789\n22.5748C39.8556 20.4517 38.9639 18.4544 37.5324 16.8707ZM22.4978\n37.8849C20.7443 37.8874 19.0459 37.2733 17.6994 36.1501C17.7601 36.117 17.8666\n36.0586 17.936 36.0161L25.9004 31.4156C26.1003 31.3019 26.2663 31.137 26.3813\n30.9378C26.4964 30.7386 26.5563 30.5124 26.5549 30.2825V19.0542L29.9213\n20.998C29.9389 21.0068 29.9541 21.0198 29.9656 21.0359C29.977 21.052 29.9842\n21.0707 29.9867 21.0902V30.3889C29.9842 32.375 29.1946 34.2791 27.7909\n35.6841C26.3872 37.0892 24.4838 37.8806 22.4978 37.8849ZM6.39227\n31.0064C5.51397 29.4888 5.19742 27.7107 5.49804 25.9832C5.55718 26.0187 5.66048\n26.0818 5.73461 26.1244L13.699 30.7248C13.8975 30.8408 14.1233 30.902 14.3532\n30.902C14.583 30.902 14.8088 30.8408 15.0073 30.7248L24.731\n25.1103V28.9979C24.7321 29.0177 24.7283 29.0376 24.7199 29.0556C24.7115 29.0736\n24.6988 29.0893 24.6829 29.1012L16.6317 33.7497C14.9096 34.7416 12.8643 35.0097\n10.9447 34.4954C9.02506 33.9811 7.38785 32.7263 6.39227 31.0064ZM4.29707\n13.6194C5.17156 12.0998 6.55279 10.9364 8.19885 10.3327C8.19885 10.4013 8.19491\n10.5228 8.19491 10.6071V19.808C8.19351 20.0378 8.25334 20.2638 8.36823\n20.4629C8.48312 20.6619 8.64893 20.8267 8.84863 20.9404L18.5723 26.5542L15.206\n28.4979C15.1894 28.5089 15.1703 28.5155 15.1505 28.5173C15.1307 28.5191 15.1107\n28.516 15.0924 28.5082L7.04046 23.8557C5.32135 22.8601 4.06716 21.2235 3.55289\n19.3046C3.03862 17.3858 3.30624 15.3413 4.29707 13.6194ZM31.955 20.0556L22.2312\n14.4411L25.5976 12.4981C25.6142 12.4872 25.6333 12.4805 25.6531 12.4787C25.6729\n12.4769 25.6928 12.4801 25.7111 12.4879L33.7631 17.1364C34.9967 17.849 36.0017\n18.8982 36.6606 20.1613C37.3194 21.4244 37.6047 22.849 37.4832 24.2684C37.3617\n25.6878 36.8382 27.0432 35.9743 28.1759C35.1103 29.3086 33.9415 30.1717 32.6047\n30.6641C32.6047 30.5947 32.6047 30.4733 32.6047 30.3889V21.188C32.6066 20.9586\n32.5474 20.7328 32.4332 20.5338C32.319 20.3348 32.154 20.1698 31.955\n20.0556ZM35.3055 15.0128C35.2464 14.9765 35.1431 14.9142 35.069 14.8717L27.1045\n10.2712C26.906 10.1554 26.6803 10.0943 26.4504 10.0943C26.2206 10.0943 25.9948\n10.1554 25.7963 10.2712L16.0726 15.8858V11.9982C16.0715 11.9783 16.0753 11.9585\n16.0837 11.9405C16.0921 11.9225 16.1048 11.9068 16.1207 11.8949L24.1719\n7.25025C25.4053 6.53903 26.8158 6.19376 28.2383 6.25482C29.6608 6.31589 31.0364\n6.78077 32.2044 7.59508C33.3723 8.40939 34.2842 9.53945 34.8334 10.8531C35.3826\n12.1667 35.5464 13.6095 35.3055 15.0128ZM14.2424 21.9419L10.8752\n19.9981C10.8576 19.9893 10.8423 19.9763 10.8309 19.9602C10.8195 19.9441 10.8122\n19.9254 10.8098 19.9058V10.6071C10.8107 9.18295 11.2173 7.78848 11.9819\n6.58696C12.7466 5.38544 13.8377 4.42659 15.1275 3.82264C16.4173 3.21869 17.8524\n2.99464 19.2649 3.1767C20.6775 3.35876 22.0089 3.93941 23.1034 4.85067C23.0427\n4.88379 22.937 4.94215 22.8668 4.98473L14.9024 9.58517C14.7025 9.69878 14.5366\n9.86356 14.4215 10.0626C14.3065 10.2616 14.2466 10.4877 14.2479 10.7175L14.2424\n21.9419ZM16.071 17.9991L20.4018 15.4978L24.7325 17.9975V22.9985L20.4018\n25.4983L16.071 22.9985V17.9991Z\");\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, the code should work.

Don't quote the full path\nagain in your response; just show a placeholder instead.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you're correct. The problem is that the data URI for the SVG needs to\ninclude the `&lt;svg&gt;` tags and not just the path string alone. You should\nreplace the path in the `background-image` property of the\n`.chatgpt-message::before` selector with the complete SVG, which includes\nthe `&lt;svg&gt;` tags and its attributes.\nHere's an example of how it should look like:\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n  background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml, [your_complete_SVG_here]\");\n}\n\nReplace `[your_complete_SVG_here]` with the complete SVG code including the `&lt;svg&gt;` tags, and it should work as expected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nOkay, the background image is working now.  It had nothing to do with needing\nto be URL-encoded, it was the missing &lt;svg&gt; tags, and then I had to change\nthe outer quotes to single quotes to nest the double quote in the string.\nHere's what the working code looks like:\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml,&lt;svg width=\"32\"\nheight=\"32\" viewBox=\"0 0 41 41\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\nstroke-width=\"1.5\" class=\"h-6 w-6\"&gt;&lt;path d=\"M37.5324 16.8707C37.9808 [...]\n25.4983L16.071 22.9985V17.9991Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;');\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGreat! I'm glad to hear that it's working now. You have correctly added the\nmissing `&lt;svg&gt;` tags and changed the outer quotes to single quotes.\nHere's the working CSS code for reference:\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml,&lt;svg width=\"32\" height=\"32\" viewBox=\"0 0 41 41\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" class=\"h-6 w-6\"&gt;&lt;path d=\"M37.5324 16.8707C37.9808 [...] 25.4983L16.071 22.9985V17.9991Z\" fill=\"currentColor\"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;');\n}\n\nNow the ChatGPT SVG avatar should be visible, and the CSS rules should work as\nintended. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free\nto ask.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWhew!  That was quite an ordeal, just to get a couple avatars working!  This\nisn't the end of the quest to find a clean solution for formatting ChatGPT\nconversations for these blog posts, but this post is quite long already, so\nI'll return to the topic in a later post.\nThis is a good stopping point, since this the point at which I diverted the\nconversation for a while to discuss a problem I had discovered for the dark\nmode theme.  I'll continue with that issue in the next post...\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/06/23/formatting-chatgpt-conversations/","title":"Formatting ChatGPT conversations."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/06/24/trouble-with-dark-mode-theme/":{"body":"I started working on formatting ChatGPT conversations in my last\npost, but along the way, I also\nstumbled across another problem with the website design.  The DeepThought theme\ncomes with a dark mode button, but I found that clicking it turned my avatar\ninto some weird inverse color image.  I decided to take a detour to research\nthis issue...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHmm, if I click the button in the upper-right corner from the DeepThought\ntheme, to switch the page to Dark Mode, it also turns the image of my avatar\ninto some sort of weird color inverse video.  How do I prevent this?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe color inversion of your avatar in Dark Mode is likely caused by a CSS rule\nthat targets images or background images and applies a filter to invert their\ncolors. To prevent this from happening to your avatar, you can add a CSS rule\nto exclude your avatar from being affected by the filter.\nYou should look for the CSS rules that apply to Dark Mode (usually they are\ninside a media query or a selector with a class like `.dark`), then find\nthe rule that inverts the colors.\nOnce you find the rule that causes the color inversion, you can add a more\nspecific rule for your avatar to override the effect. Here's an example of how\nto do this:\n/* Assuming the rule that inverts colors looks like this */\n.dark img {\n  filter: invert(1);\n}\n\n/* Add a more specific rule to exclude the ChatGPT avatar */\n.dark .chatgpt-message::before {\n  filter: invert(0);\n}\n\nThe code above assumes that the Dark Mode rules are applied using the\n`.dark` class. Adjust the selectors according to your theme's structure.\nBy setting the `filter` property to `invert(0)` for your avatar,\nyou disable the inversion effect and prevent it from being affected by the Dark\nMode color inversion.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWould a \"!important\" rule be better?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUsing `!important` can also work in this situation, but it's generally\nrecommended to avoid using it when possible, as it can lead to maintenance\nissues and make it more difficult to override styles in the future. It's better\nto use more specific selectors instead, as they tend to create more\nmaintainable and structured CSS.\nHowever, if you're having trouble overriding the color inversion using more\nspecific selectors, or you prefer a quick solution, you can use\n`!important`. Here's how to apply it in your case:\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n  filter: invert(0) !important;\n}\n\nBy adding `!important` to the `filter` property, you ensure that\nthis rule takes precedence over any other rule that sets the `filter`\nproperty for the `.chatgpt-message::before` selector. Keep in mind that\nusing `!important` should be a last resort, and it's better to try more\nspecific selectors first.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThis appears to be the source of the problem, in\n\"themes/DeepThought/sass/deep-thought.sass\":\nbody[theme=\"dark\"]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThank you for providing the source of the problem. In this case, the dark theme\nis using a filter to invert the colors and apply a hue rotation to the entire\nbody, which is causing the issue with your avatar. To prevent this, you can\noverride the filter specifically for your avatar element.\nIf your avatar is contained within an element with a specific class or ID, you\ncan target that selector and reset the filter. Let's say your avatar is inside\nan element with a class of `.avatar`. You can add the following CSS rule:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .avatar {\n  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);\n}\n\nThis rule will reset the filter applied to the `.avatar` element when the\ndark theme is active. Make sure to replace `.avatar` with the correct\nselector that targets your avatar element.\nIf your avatar is using the `.chatgpt-message::before` pseudo-element,\nyou can modify the rule like this:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .chatgpt-message::before {\n  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);\n}\n\nThis will prevent the color inversion and hue rotation from being applied to\nthe avatar when the dark theme is enabled.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHow does the SASS file translate into CSS?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends\nthe capabilities of CSS by allowing variables, nested rules, mixins, and more.\nSASS files need to be compiled into CSS files for browsers to interpret and\napply the styles.\nHere's a basic example of how SASS translates into CSS:\nSASS:\n$primary-color: #3498db\n\nbody\n  background-color: $primary-color\n\n  h1\n    color: darken($primary-color, 20%)\n\nCompiled CSS:\nbody {\n  background-color: #3498db;\n}\n\nbody h1 {\n  color: #1c5a87;\n}\n\nIn the SASS file, we defined a variable `$primary-color` and used it to\nset the `background-color` property for the `body` element. The\n`h1` elements inside the `body` get their `color` property\nset to a darker version of the `$primary-color` using the `darken`\nfunction.\nWhen the SASS file is compiled, it generates the corresponding CSS file. The\nvariables, functions, and nested rules are resolved into standard CSS syntax\nthat can be interpreted by browsers.\nTo compile SASS files into CSS, you can use command-line tools like\n`sass` (Dart Sass) or `node-sass`, or integrated tools in task\nrunners like Grunt, Gulp, or Webpack.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt looks like the CSS file just contains body[theme=dark]{filter:invert(1)\nhue-rotate(180deg)}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf the compiled CSS file contains the following rule:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] {\n  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\n\nThis rule targets the `body` element when it has an attribute\n`theme` set to `\"dark\"`. When this condition is met, it applies a\nfilter that inverts the colors (with `invert(1)`) and rotates the hue by\n180 degrees (with `hue-rotate(180deg)`).\nThis rule is causing the color inversion issue with your avatar image when the\ndark mode is activated.\nTo prevent this issue, you can add a more specific rule to target only the\navatar image and cancel the filter applied by the `body[theme=\"dark\"]`\nrule. Add the following CSS rule to your custom CSS file:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .your-avatar-selector {\n  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\n\nReplace `.your-avatar-selector` with the actual selector (class, ID, or\nelement) that targets your avatar image. This rule will apply the same filter\nto the avatar image, effectively canceling the filter applied by the\n`body[theme=\"dark\"]` rule, and preserving the original appearance of your\navatar image.\n      \n    \n  \n\nLooks like ChatGPT is getting confused again...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \ninvert(1)?  You said invert(0) before.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion. You are correct. To cancel the filter applied by\nthe `body[theme=\"dark\"]` rule, you should use `invert(0)` and\n`hue-rotate(0deg)`. Here's the correct CSS rule:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .your-avatar-selector {\n  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);\n}\n\nReplace `.your-avatar-selector` with the actual selector (class, ID, or\nelement) that targets your avatar image. This rule will effectively cancel the\nfilter applied by the `body[theme=\"dark\"]` rule and preserve the original\nappearance of your avatar image when the dark mode is activated.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThis didn't work:\n.user-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n}\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .user-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion earlier. In this case, since the avatar is being\nused as a background image, we'll have to create an additional wrapper element\nfor the avatar and apply the filter on that element. Here's a modified\napproach:\n1. Wrap the avatar inside a separate div element with a class (for\nexample, `avatar-wrapper`):\n&lt;div class=\"avatar-wrapper\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"user-message\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n1. Modify your CSS to apply the background image to the\n`.avatar-wrapper` element and add the filter to cancel the dark mode\neffect:\n.avatar-wrapper {\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n  width: 32px; /* Adjust the width as needed */\n  height: 32px; /* Adjust the height as needed */\n}\n\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .avatar-wrapper {\n  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);\n}\n\nThis should prevent the avatar from being affected by the dark mode filter\nwhile maintaining the original appearance.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I put that &lt;div&gt; element inside the \"content\" string here?\n.chatgpt-message::before,\n.user-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;content: \"\";\n&nbsp;&nbsp;display: inline-block;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1rem;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUnfortunately, you cannot directly include HTML elements inside the\n`content` property of a pseudo-element in CSS.\nInstead, you can create a separate div element for each avatar and include it\nwithin the `.chatgpt-message` and `.user-message` elements, like\nso:\n&lt;div class=\"chatgpt-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar-wrapper chatgpt-avatar\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Rest of the message content --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar-wrapper user-avatar\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Rest of the message content --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThen, update your CSS to apply the background image to the\n`.avatar-wrapper` elements, and add the filter to cancel the dark mode\neffect:\n.chatgpt-avatar {\n  background-image: url('/images/chatgpt_avatar.webp');\n}\n\n.user-avatar {\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n}\n\n.avatar-wrapper {\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n  background-size: cover;\n  vertical-align: top;\n}\n\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .avatar-wrapper {\n  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);\n}\n\nThis approach allows you to maintain the original appearance of the avatars and\nprevents them from being affected by the dark mode filter.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nStill not working.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. In this case, let's try a different approach.\nYou can use the `mix-blend-mode` CSS property to counteract the dark mode\neffect on the avatars.\nHere's the modified CSS:\n.chatgpt-message::before,\n.user-message::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n  background-size: cover;\n  vertical-align: top;\n  mix-blend-mode: difference;\n}\n\n.chatgpt-message::before {\n  background-image: url('/images/chatgpt_avatar.webp');\n}\n\n.user-message::before {\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n}\n\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .chatgpt-message::before,\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .user-message::before {\n  mix-blend-mode: normal;\n}\n\nThis CSS code utilizes the `mix-blend-mode` property to counteract the\neffect of the dark mode filter on the avatars. When the dark mode is enabled,\nthe `mix-blend-mode` is set back to `normal`, so the avatars should\ndisplay correctly.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThat mix-blend-mode seems to be inverting the image in the normal mode.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. Since the `mix-blend-mode` property did\nnot work as expected, let's revert to our previous strategy using the\n`&lt;div&gt;` element for the avatar images. We will wrap the avatar in a\n`&lt;div&gt;` and apply the `filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg)` style\nto the parent `&lt;div&gt;` in the dark mode.\nHere's the modified HTML:\n&lt;div class=\"chatgpt-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar-wrapper\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"chatgpt-avatar\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Hello, how can I help you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"avatar-wrapper\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"user-avatar\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What is the weather like today?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nAnd the CSS:\n.avatar-wrapper {\n  display: inline-block;\n  vertical-align: top;\n}\n\n.chatgpt-avatar,\n.user-avatar {\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n  background-size: cover;\n}\n\n.chatgpt-avatar {\n  background-image: url('/images/chatgpt_avatar.webp');\n}\n\n.user-avatar {\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n}\n\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .avatar-wrapper {\n  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);\n}\n\nThis should work correctly in both normal and dark modes, without affecting the\nappearance of the avatar images.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAny thoughts about this Stack Overflow page?\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of the Stack Overflow\npage.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe Stack Overflow page you've shared is discussing a similar issue, where the\nauthor is trying to invert the colors of a webpage for a dark theme, while\nkeeping the images unchanged. The accepted answer suggests inverting the images\ntwice, which effectively cancels out the inversion.\nHowever, in your case, we have already taken a different approach by wrapping\nthe avatar images in a `&lt;div&gt;` element and applying the filter to the\nparent `&lt;div&gt;` in dark mode. This should work correctly without the\nneed for inverting the images twice.\nThe key takeaway from the Stack Overflow discussion is that inverting colors\nmay not be the best approach for implementing a dark mode, as it could lead to\nunpredictable results. Instead, it's generally better to define specific styles\nfor light and dark modes, giving you more control over the appearance of\nelements in both modes.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHere's another:\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of another Stack Overflow\npage\nthat I found.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe solution provided in this Stack Overflow post suggests using a\n`::after` pseudo-element to apply the background image and then inverting\nit by the same amount as the main element. This way, the image will appear in\nits original form. Here's how you can adapt this solution for your case:\n\n\nApply the `::after` pseudo-element to the `.user-message` class.\n\n\nAdd the `filter: invert(1)` to the `body[theme=\"dark\"]\n.user-message::after` selector.\n\n\nHere's the updated code:\n.user-message {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\n.user-message::after {\n  content: \"\";\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n  background-size: cover;\n  vertical-align: top;\n}\n\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .user-message::after {\n  filter: invert(1);\n}\n\nThis code snippet creates an `::after` pseudo-element for\n`.user-message` to display the avatar image. It applies a `filter:\ninvert(1)` only when the theme is set to \"dark\", so the image will appear in\nits original form.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHere's a thread elsewhere:\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of yet another\nthread\nthat I found which appeared relevant.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBased on the thread you provided, it seems like users are having trouble\nexcluding images from being affected by the dark mode in their websites. A\ncommon solution mentioned in the thread is to add the \"darkmode-ignore\" class\nto the images or their container elements. Additionally, you can try increasing\nthe z-index value for the images.\nHere's a code snippet that you can add to the Additional CSS section in the\nWordPress customizer to increase the z-index value for all images:\nimg { \n  z-index: 1001;\n}\n\nKeep in mind that the solutions provided in the thread might not work for\neveryone, as the implementation of dark mode could vary depending on the theme,\npage builder, and other factors.\nIf you're still having issues with images being affected by dark mode, you\nmight need to explore custom solutions based on your website's specific setup.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nGive me the best solution for this issue that you can, and explain how and why\nit should work.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe best solution to exclude images from being affected by the dark mode on\nyour website would be to combine the use of the \"darkmode-ignore\" class and\nadjusting the z-index property for images. Here's why this approach should\nwork:\n\n\n\"darkmode-ignore\" class: When the dark mode plugin processes the page, it\nlooks for elements with the \"darkmode-ignore\" class and avoids applying dark\nmode styles to those elements. By adding this class to your images or their\ncontainer elements, you're explicitly telling the plugin to ignore these images\nwhen applying the dark mode styles.\n\n\nAdjusting the z-index property: The z-index property determines the stacking\norder of elements on a web page. Elements with a higher z-index value are\nplaced in front of elements with lower z-index values. By setting the z-index\nof the images higher than the dark mode layer, you ensure that the images will\nbe displayed above the dark mode layer, and the original image colors will be\npreserved.\n\n\nHere's how you can implement this solution:\nStep 1: Add the \"darkmode-ignore\" class to images\nIn your HTML code, add the \"darkmode-ignore\" class to the images or their\ncontainer elements. For example:\n&lt;img src=\"your-image-source.jpg\" alt=\"Your Image Description\" class=\"darkmode-ignore\"&gt;\n\nStep 2: Increase the z-index value for images\nAdd the following CSS code snippet to the Additional CSS section in the\nWordPress customizer or in your theme's stylesheet (style.css file):\nimg.darkmode-ignore { \n  position: relative;\n  z-index: 1001;\n}\n\nThis code will target all images with the \"darkmode-ignore\" class, setting\ntheir position property to \"relative\" (so that the z-index property can be\napplied) and increasing their z-index value to 1001.\nBy combining these two approaches, you should be able to exclude images from\nbeing affected by the dark mode on your website. Remember that the exact\nimplementation and results might vary depending on your theme, page builder,\nand other factors, so you might need to adjust the solution to better suit your\nspecific setup.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I took a detour from the detour to talk about pretty-printing\nCSS.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe SASS compiled into CSS for the DeepThought theme is all run together like this: \"@import url(\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800;1,900&amp;display=swap\");html{scroll-behavior:smooth}body{font-family:\"Jost\",sans-serif;display:flex;flex-direction:column;min-height:100vh}body[theme=dark]{filter:invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)}section{flex:1}img[theme=dark],picture[theme=dark],video[theme=dark],pre[theme=dark]{filter:invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)}.pagination-previous,[...]\"  What's the best way to format this readably?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo make the SASS compiled CSS for the DeepThought theme more readable, you can\nuse a CSS formatter or beautifier.

To do this, you can use\nthe `!` command in combination with an external command-line tool. The\n`!` command allows you to filter your text through an external program.\nFor example, you can use the `css-beautify` tool from the\n`js-beautify` package. First, you need to install it globally using\n`npm`:\nnpm install -g js-beautify\n\nAfter installing the package, open your CSS file in Vim and execute the\nfollowing command:\n:%!css-beautify -t -s 2\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n\n`%` represents the entire file.\n\n\n`!` tells Vim to filter the selected range through the external command that follows.\n\n\n`css-beautify` is the external command.\n\n\n`-t` flag tells `css-beautify` to use tabs for indentation.\n\n\n`-s 2` specifies the number of spaces per indentation level (use either `-t` or `-s 2`, not both).\n\n\nThis will format your CSS code with the specified indentation settings.\nKeep in mind that this requires an active internet connection and `npm`\ninstalled on your system.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I do it natively in vim with its builtin CSS indentation rules, without running an external program?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can do it natively in Vim using its built-in indentation and\nformatting rules for CSS. Here's a step-by-step process to format your CSS code\nin Vim:\n\n\nFirst, open your CSS file in Vim.\n\n\nType the following command to enable filetype plugins:\n\n\n:filetype plugin on\n\nNext, set the file type to `css` by typing:\n:set filetype=css\n\nSet the indentation settings for CSS. Type the following commands:\n:set expandtab\n:set tabstop=2\n:set shiftwidth=2\n:set softtabstop=2\n\nThese commands configure Vim to use spaces instead of tabs and set the\nindentation width to 2 spaces.\nNow, format your CSS code using the following command:\n:gg=G\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n\n`gg` moves the cursor to the first line of the file.\n\n\n`=` applies indentation based on the current settings.\n\n\n`G` selects the range from the current line (the first line) to the\nlast line.\n\n\nYour CSS code should now be formatted according to Vim's built-in indentation\nrules for CSS. Note that this method only adjusts the indentation, but doesn't\nbeautify the CSS code in the same way as external tools like\n`css-beautify`.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\"gg=G\" is not a command-line command.  =G in normal mode would work if the code\nwere on multiple lines, but it's all on a single line so it doesn't work.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion. You're right, the method I previously mentioned is\nonly useful when the CSS code is already split into multiple lines. To format\nthe minified CSS in Vim without using an external program, you can use a\ncombination of substitution and normal mode commands. Follow these steps:\n\n\nOpen your CSS file in Vim.\n\n\nType the following command to insert line breaks after specific characters:\n\n\n:%s/;\\|}/&amp;\\r/g\n\nThis command searches for semicolons (`;`) and closing curly braces\n(`}`) and inserts a line break (`\\r`) after each occurrence.\n\nNext, set the file type to `css` by typing:\n\n:set filetype=css\n\n\nSet the indentation settings for CSS. Type the following commands:\n\n:set expandtab\n:set tabstop=2\n:set shiftwidth=2\n:set softtabstop=2\n\nThese commands configure Vim to use spaces instead of tabs and set the\nindentation width to 2 spaces.\n\nNow, format your CSS code using the following normal mode command:\n\n:gg=G\n\nThis command adjusts the indentation based on the current settings.\nWith this approach, the CSS code should be split into multiple lines and\nproperly indented. Note that this method may not be as comprehensive as using\nan external tool like `css-beautify`, but it should provide a more\nreadable format for your CSS code.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI like \"%s/[;}]/&amp;\\r/g\" better.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're right. The regular expression `%s/[;}]/&amp;\\r/g` is a simpler and\nmore efficient way to achieve the same result. It will match either a semicolon\n(`;`) or a closing curly brace (`}`) and insert a line break\n(`\\r`) after each occurrence.\nHere are the updated steps:\n\n\nOpen your CSS file in Vim.\n\n\nType the following command to insert line breaks after specific characters:\n\n\n:%s/[;}]/&amp;\\r/g\n\n\nNext, set the file type to `css` by typing:\n\n:set filetype=css\n\n\nSet the indentation settings for CSS. Type the following commands:\n\n:set expandtab\n:set tabstop=2\n:set shiftwidth=2\n:set softtabstop=2\n\n\nNow, format your CSS code using the following normal mode command:\n\n:gg=G\n\nWith this approach, the CSS code should be split into multiple lines and\nproperly indented.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI should note that ChatGPT's instructions still contain an error.  The command\nin normal mode should be gg=G, not :gg=G.  The colon\nwould start a command in command mode, and the gg and\n=G commands need to be executed in normal mode, not in command\nmode.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf I use an external program, what are the best open source CSS beautifier\nprograms for Linux?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThere are several open-source CSS beautifiers available for Linux. Here are\nthree popular ones:\n1. Prettier (https://prettier.io/): Prettier is a\nwidely-used code formatter that supports various programming languages,\nincluding CSS, SCSS, and Less. It is easy to integrate with most text editors\nand IDEs, and has a comprehensive set of options to control the formatting.\nTo install Prettier globally via npm, run:\nnpm install --global prettier\n\nTo format a CSS file using Prettier, run:\nprettier --write &lt;input-file.css&gt;\n\n1. css-beautify\n(https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify): css-beautify is part\nof the js-beautify project, which provides beautification for CSS, HTML, and\nJavaScript files. It is available as a command-line tool as well as a library\nfor use in other programs.\nTo install css-beautify globally via npm, run:\nnpm install --global js-beautify\n\nTo format a CSS file using css-beautify, run:\ncss-beautify -o &lt;output-file.css&gt; &lt;input-file.css&gt;\n\n1. stylelint (https://stylelint.io/): stylelint is a\nmodern CSS linter and fixer that helps you avoid errors and enforce consistent\nconventions in your styles. It can also auto-format your CSS code using its\n`--fix` option.\nTo install stylelint globally via npm, run:\nnpm install --global stylelint\n\nTo configure stylelint, create a `.stylelintrc.json` file in your project directory with the following content:\n{\n  \"extends\": \"stylelint-config-recommended\",\n  \"rules\": {}\n}\n\nTo format a CSS file using stylelint, run:\nstylelint &lt;input-file.css&gt; --fix\n\nThese tools should help you format your CSS code consistently and maintain a\nreadable codebase. Choose the one that best fits your workflow and project\nrequirements.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAre there any written in Rust and Perl?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there are CSS beautifiers written in Rust and Perl as well. Here are\nexamples for each:\n1. Rust: `rust-css-minifier`\n(https://github.com/robmikh/rust-css-minifier) - Although primarily\na CSS minifier, it can also format CSS to be more readable.\nTo install `rust-css-minifier`, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed\non your system. Then run:\ncargo install css-minifier\n\nTo format a CSS file using `rust-css-minifier`, run:\ncss-minifier --pretty &lt;input-file.css&gt; -o &lt;output-file.css&gt;\n\nNote that this tool is more focused on minification, and the beautification\nsupport might not be as comprehensive as other dedicated CSS beautifiers.\n1. Perl: `CSS::Prettify`\n(https://metacpan.org/pod/CSS::Prettify) - This Perl module is a CSS\nformatter that can be used as a command-line tool or integrated into a Perl\nscript.\nTo install `CSS::Prettify`, use the `cpanm` command:\ncpanm CSS::Prettify\n\nOnce installed, you can use the `css-prettify` command-line tool to\nformat a CSS file:\ncss-prettify -i &lt;input-file.css&gt; -o &lt;output-file.css&gt;\n\nKeep in mind that the popularity and community support for these tools may not\nbe as extensive as those for the previously mentioned options, but they can\nstill be useful if you prefer working with Rust or Perl.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, back to the original detour!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSo it looks like the \"img\" CSS rule in the DeepThought theme is trying to avoid\nthe problem I'm encountering...\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\nsection {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1;\n}\nimg[theme=\"dark\"],\npicture[theme=\"dark\"],\nvideo[theme=\"dark\"],\npre[theme=\"dark\"] {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, it seems the DeepThought theme is designed to handle the dark mode by\napplying the `filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);` CSS rule to various\nelements when the `theme` attribute is set to \"dark\". This creates the\nappearance of a dark theme by inverting the colors and rotating the hue.\nThe following rules are applied when the theme is set to \"dark\":\n\n\nFor the body element: All the content within the `body` will be\ninverted and have the hue rotated by 180 degrees.\n\n\nFor `img`, `picture`, `video`, and `pre` elements\nwith a `theme=\"dark\"` attribute: These elements will have their colors\ninverted and hue rotated by 180 degrees. This is done to maintain the original\nappearance of these elements in dark mode, as their colors would otherwise be\ndoubly inverted (once by the `body` rule and once by their own rule).\n\n\nThis approach helps to create a dark mode experience without requiring\nsignificant additional CSS or adjustments to the HTML structure.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI'm not sure why ChatGPT says \"as their colors would otherwise be doubly\ninverted\" above.  It seems clear that those elements are being doubly\ninverted to cancel out the inversion from the `body` rule.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSo is it failing to work here because of using background-image()?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, that's correct. The reason the dark mode isn't working as expected for the\nelement with a `background-image()` is because the CSS rules in the\nDeepThought theme target only certain elements like `img`,\n`picture`, `video`, and `pre` with a `theme=\"dark\"`\nattribute. The `filter` property applied to these elements doesn't affect\nthe `background-image()` of other elements.\nTo fix this issue, you can create a new CSS rule targeting the specific element\nwith the background image and apply the same `filter` property when the\n`theme` attribute is set to \"dark\". Assuming the element with the\nbackground image has a class name of `background-element`, you can add\nthe following CSS rule:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .background-element {\n  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\n\nThis rule will apply the desired color inversion and hue rotation effect to the\n`background-image()` of the `.background-element` when the theme is\nset to \"dark\".\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHow can I set the CSS class on the background image here?\n.user-message::before {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou cannot directly set a CSS class on a background image, but you can set a\nclass on the element that has the `::before` pseudo-element. Here's an\nexample of how you can apply the dark mode effect to the background image using\na class:\n1. Add a class (e.g., `dark-bg-image`) to the element that\ncurrently has the `user-message` class:\n&lt;div class=\"user-message dark-bg-image\"&gt;Your message here&lt;/div&gt;\n\n1. Modify the CSS rule for the dark mode to target the\n`::before` pseudo-element of the element with the `dark-bg-image`\nclass:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] .dark-bg-image::before {\n  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\n\n1. Finally, update your existing CSS rule to use the new\n`dark-bg-image` class:\n.dark-bg-image::before {\n  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');\n  /* other styles for the ::before pseudo-element */\n}\n\nWith these changes, the dark mode effect will be applied to the\n`background-image` of the `::before` pseudo-element when the\n`theme` attribute is set to \"dark\".\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI think that what I want is two new Zola shortcodes that I could use like this\nin the Markdown file:\n{% user_msg %}\nMy question?\n{% end %}\n{% chatgpt_msg %}\nFirst message from ChatGPT\n...\nmultiline of course\n{% end %}\n{% user_msg %}\nMy response.\n{% end %}\n{% chatgpt_msg %}\nSecond response from ChatGPT, etc.\n{% end %}\nThe shortcodes should then implement whatever is needed: &lt;div&gt; and\n&lt;blockquote&gt; tags, WEBP and SVG avatars, etc.  How should I implement this?\nBear in mind the Zola Shortcodes documentation (repeated below):\n[Here I copied and pasted the content of the Zola\nshortcodes\ndocumentation page again.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo create shortcodes for user_msg and chatgpt_msg, you can follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n\nIn your Zola project, navigate to the `templates/shortcodes`\ndirectory.  If it does not exist, create it.\n\n\nCreate two new shortcode templates, `user_msg.html` and\n`chatgpt_msg.html`, inside the `templates/shortcodes` directory.\n\n\nIn `user_msg.html`, add the following code:\n\n\n&lt;div class=\"user-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"user-avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/user_avatar.webp\" alt=\"User Avatar\"&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;blockquote&gt;\n    {{ body }}\n  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIn `chatgpt_msg.html`, add the following code:\n\n&lt;div class=\"chatgpt-message\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"chatgpt-avatar\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/chatgpt_avatar.svg\" alt=\"ChatGPT Avatar\"&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;blockquote&gt;\n    {{ body }}\n  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\nUpdate your site's CSS to style the new classes, `user-message`,\n`user-avatar`, `chatgpt-message`, and `chatgpt-avatar`, as\nneeded.\n\n\nNow, you can use the shortcodes in your Markdown files like this:\n\n\n{% user_msg %}\nMy question?\n{% end %}\n\n{% chatgpt_msg %}\nFirst message from ChatGPT\n...\nmultiline of course\n{% end %}\n\n{% user_msg %}\nMy response.\n{% end %}\n\n{% chatgpt_msg %}\nSecond response from ChatGPT, etc.\n{% end %}\n\nThese shortcodes will generate the appropriate HTML structure and include the\navatars for both user messages and ChatGPT messages. Don't forget to include\nthe necessary CSS for styling the message blocks and avatars.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I took a break from chatting with ChatGPT and just continued\nresearching and experimenting on my own until I came up with a solution that I\nwas happy with:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHere's the solution that I finally settled on.  First I made several shortcode\ntemplates, starting with \"templates/shortcodes/first_msg.html\":\n&lt;div class=\"chatgpt-conversation\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=\"/images/deven_avatar.jpg\" alt=\"Deven T. Corzine\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;\nNext is \"templates/shortcodes/chatgpt_msg.html\":\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-block chatgpt-message\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=\"/images/chatgpt_avatar.svg\" alt=\"ChatGPT Avatar\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;\nNext is \"templates/shortcodes/user_msg.html\":\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=\"/images/deven_avatar.webp\" alt=\"Deven T. Corzine\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;\nFinally I have \"templates/shortcodes/last_msg.html\":\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nYou'll notice that the HTML tags in each template are unbalanced.  This is\nintentional, because it allows me to render a ChatGPT conversation like this in\nthe Markdown content file:\n{{ first_msg() }}\nText of the first message sent from me to ChatGPT goes here.\n{{ chatgpt_msg() }}\nChatGPT's reply to my first message goes here.\n{{ user_msg() }}\nText of the second message sent from me to ChatGPT goes here.\n{{ chatgpt_msg() }}\nChatGPT's reply to my second message goes here.\n{{ user_msg() }}\nText of the third message sent from me to ChatGPT goes here.\n{{ chatgpt_msg() }}\nChatGPT's reply to my third message goes here.\n{{ last_msg() }}\nThis allows me to very quickly and easily render an entire ChatGPT conversation\nwith many back-and-forth exchanges with minimal markup coding in the content\nfile.\nI moved the ChatGPT avatar SVG code into a standalone\n\"static/images/chatgpt_avatar.svg\" file, displayed by the &lt;img&gt; tag in the\n\"chatgpt_msg\" shortcode template.  Why didn't you suggest this option when we\nwere trying to figure out the SVG?\nFinally, I have the following CSS rules for styling the conversation:\n.chatgpt-conversation {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid #d4d4d4;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 1.5rem;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0px;\n}\n.message-block {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: top;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 1rem;\n}\n.avatar {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 0 0 auto;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1.5rem;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;\n}\n.avatar img {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border-radius: 2px;\n}\n.message-content {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1 1 auto;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;\n}\n.message-content blockquote {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 1em;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border: none;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;\n}\n.chatgpt-message {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #f7f7f7;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border-top: 1px solid #d4d4d4;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom: 1px solid #d4d4d4;\n}\nbody[theme=dark] .chatgpt-message {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #eaeaea;\n}\nThe result isn't precisely the same as the chat.openai.com website, but it's\nsimilar and looks good.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYour solution is a creative approach to implementing a ChatGPT conversation\nusing Zola shortcodes. By breaking the conversation into different shortcode\ntemplates, you can easily add and remove messages in the conversation while\nkeeping your Markdown content clean and minimal.\nAs for the SVG avatar, I apologize for not suggesting that option earlier.\nMoving the SVG code into a standalone file and displaying it using the\n`&lt;img&gt;` tag is a good approach, as it makes the code more modular and\nreusable.\nYour CSS rules seem to be tailored to your specific design needs, and if the\nresult is visually appealing and similar to the chat.openai.com website, then\nit's a successful implementation.\nOverall, your solution is well thought out, and it provides a flexible way to\nrender ChatGPT conversations within your Zola project.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis is the end of the quest to find a way to nicely format ChatGPT\nconversations, so it's a good stopping place.  I did encounter some issues with\nMarkdown formatting inside HTML tags; I'll cover that topic in my next post.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/06/24/trouble-with-dark-mode-theme/","title":"Trouble with dark mode theme."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/08/05/wrapping-up-the-origin-story/":{"body":"Well, it's been over a month again since my last\npost.  July was a busy month again,\nespecially because I was a\nspeaker\nat The Perl and Raku Conference 2023 in\nToronto, Ontario, Canada.  The recording of my Making Sense of Regular\nExpressions talk is on YouTube.\nMore on that later -- this post is about wrapping up the origin story of this\nblog, although there's still a bit more to come...\n\nTo recap the story so far:\n\n\nI decided on \"CodeReflections\" for the name of this blog, and registered the\n\"codereflections.com\" domain name: What's in a\nname?\n\n\nI explored some of the basics decisions I needed to consider, such as\nwhether to use a dynamic site (like WordPress) or a static site generator\n(like Jekyll), monetization options, various blogging platforms to consider,\npossibly using GitHub Pages for free hosting, setting up a separate GitHub\naccount for the blog, HTML/CSS layout design, website theme options, options\nfor hosting comments for static sites, and privacy considerations: How the\nsausage is made.\n\n\nI researched many hosting options and decided to get a cheap ($4/month)\nvirtual private server (VPS) from BuyVM which I could use to host the site\n(at least initially) and to host some sort of comment system, and which will be\ncapable of running Docker containers if I choose to: Searching for a hosting\nprovider...\n\n\nI researched the various blogging platform options in depth, and decided to\ntry using the Zola static site generator\n(written in Rust) for the blog: Choosing a blogging\nplatform.\n\n\nI researched several interesting privacy-oriented options for integrating\ncomment support with a static site using local data storage (not decided yet\nbut leaning toward Remark42), vented to ChatGPT about\nthe lack of simple client-side HTML include functionality, debated whether Git\nrepository bloat is a concern, and asked about AdBlock detection: Choosing a\ncomment system.\n\n\nI explored many theme options for Zola and considered whether it might be\nworth porting any Jekyll themes to Zola, decided to imitate WordPress URLs,\ndiscussed some of the mechanics of making blog posts with Zola, and ultimately\ndecided to start with Zola's DeepThought theme: Choosing a website\ntheme.\n\n\nI decided to style the blog's name as \"CodeReflections\" instead of \"Code\nReflections\", did some tuning/debugging on the DeepThought theme, debated\ncategory/tag taxonomies, contemplated a separate personal blog, debated the\nnumber of posts to display per page, explored how to implement \"infinite\nscrolling\" for a static site, fixed the navigation bar to the top of the\nscreen, discussed \"front matter\" metadata, researched Vim syntax highlighting\nfor Markdown/TOML and Vim plugin managers, discussed an imaginary \"vim-zola\"\nplugin that ChatGPT randomly hallicunated, searched Google and found a real\nNeovim plugin for Zola which also works on Vim, discussed more details about\nblog post \"front matter\" metadata and creating future posts: Fine-tuning the\nwebsite theme.\n\n\nI worked with ChatGPT to figure out how to render my ChatGPT conversations\nnicely in HTML for the blog posts, and resolved various issues with avatars:\nFormatting ChatGPT\nconversations.\n\n\nI explored a problem with the DeepThought theme's dark mode causing the\ncolors of my avatar image to be inverted, detoured into a discussion about\npretty-printing CSS, and developed a solution for improving and simplifying the\nrendering of ChatGPT conversations using Zola \"shortcodes\": Trouble with dark\nmode theme.\n\n\nI want to finish this origin story and move on to other topics, so I'm going to\nquote less of the remaining ChatGPT conversation and summarize more.\nI discussed linking between different blog posts using relative permalink path\nURLs, my intention to avoid changing the permalink structure (to avoid breaking\nold bookmarks and hurting SEO), and some issues with Markdown links not being\nrendered.  This issue turned out to be caused by attempting to use Markdown\nformatting inside an &lt;ol&gt; tag in the content file, which caused Zola to\nskip Markdown processing inside that tag.\nThe initial workaround I found was to simply use Markdown to generate the\n&lt;ol&gt; block instead, by prefixing each item with a number and a period.\nThis had some limitations, which I revisited later.\nI discussed how code boxes inside formatted ChatGPT conversations were causing\nthe block quote to be too wide and overflow the box, and worked with ChatGPT to\nfigure out how to fix it and add a horizontal scrollbar in this situation.\nThis took a lot of back-and-forth discussion and experimentation because many\nof the suggestions ChatGPT gave simply didn't work as hoped or predicted.\nChatGPT suggested a dozen different approaches to try to fix the CSS to\nsolve the problem, but every single one of them either did the wrong thing\n(like wrapping the text) or just did nothing.  By the 12th\nsuggestion, ChatGPT was even starting to sound a bit frustrated...  ChatGPT\nactually recommended that I seek assistance elsewhere!!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI don't want to use the full width of the parent container.  I have margins on\nthe conversation box.  Here's my CSS right now:\n.chatgpt-conversation {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid #d4d4d4;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 1.5rem;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.message-block {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: top;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 1rem;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.avatar {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 0 0 auto;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1.5rem;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;\n}\n\n.avatar img {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border-radius: 2px;\n}\n\n.message-content {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1 1 auto;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;position: relative;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.message-content blockquote {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 1em;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border: none;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.message-content blockquote pre {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;overflow-x: auto;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.chatgpt-message {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #f7f7f7;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border-top: 1px solid #d4d4d4;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom: 1px solid #d4d4d4;\n}\n\nbody[theme=dark] .chatgpt-message {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #eaeaea;\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. In this case, you can try adding `box-sizing: border-box;` to the `.message-content` class:\n.message-content {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n  vertical-align: top;\n  position: relative;\n  max-width: 100%;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nThis will ensure that the padding and border are included in the element's\ntotal width, rather than added to it. This should help constrain the width of\nthe content within the conversation box. If this still doesn't work, there may\nbe other factors involved that are beyond the scope of this conversation. In\nthat case, I recommend seeking assistance from a web development expert or\ncommunity forum to help you troubleshoot the issue further.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWhen this suggestion failed as well, ChatGPT just gave up outright!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAgain, that did nothing.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. It seems that we have exhausted the options I\ncan provide as an AI language model. I would recommend seeking assistance from\na web development expert or community forum to help you troubleshoot the issue\nfurther. They will be able to work with you interactively and provide a more\nhands-on approach to find the solution that works best for your specific case.\n      \n    \n  \n\nNope, I refuse to accept that answer.  It's time to try a different approach to\nsee if ChatGPT can actually help, despite this pessimistic response...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nRemember the shortcodes I have:\n==&gt; templates/shortcodes/chatgpt_msg.html &lt;==\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-block chatgpt-message\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=\"/images/chatgpt_avatar.svg\" alt=\"ChatGPT Avatar\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-content\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n\n==&gt; templates/shortcodes/first_msg.html &lt;==\n&lt;div class=\"chatgpt-conversation\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"message-block user-message\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=\"avatar\"&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=\"/images/deven_avatar.jpg\" alt=\"Deven T.

They are designed to create the\nstructure for your ChatGPT conversation, with unbalanced HTML tags that allow\nyou to render a conversation with minimal markup coding in the content file.\nYou have four shortcode templates:\n\n\n`first_msg.html` - Represents the beginning of the conversation with\nthe user message.\n\n\n`chatgpt_msg.html` - Represents a ChatGPT message within the\nconversation.\n\n\n`user_msg.html` - Represents a user message within the conversation.\n\n\n`last_msg.html` - Represents the end of the conversation, closing the\nHTML structure.\n\n\nThese shortcodes help you to easily create a conversation between the user and\nChatGPT by including them in your Markdown content file.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nNow, explain to me step-by-step, one element at a time, what controls the width\nof each element and why it should or shouldn't work as I need it to.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI'll break down the CSS rules you provided and explain how they control the\nwidth and layout of the conversation elements.\n\n\n `.chatgpt-conversation`:\n\n\n`max-width: 100%;` ensures that the conversation container does not\nexceed the width of its parent container.\n\n\n`margin: 1.5rem;` applies a margin around the conversation container,\nseparating it from other elements.\n\n\n`padding: 0px;` removes any padding from the conversation container.\n\n\n\n `.message-block`:\n\n\n`display: flex;` enables flexbox for the message block, allowing you to\nalign and position the avatar and message content horizontally.\n\n\n`align-items: top;` aligns the avatar and message content to the top of\nthe flex container.\n\n\n`padding: 1rem;` adds padding around the message block, separating it\nfrom the other messages.\n\n\n`max-width: 100%;` ensures the message block does not exceed the width\nof its parent container, which is the conversation container.\n\n\n\n `.avatar`:\n\n\n`flex: 0 0 auto;` sets the avatar's width and height to not grow or\nshrink, and to be determined by the auto value (based on the content).\n\n\n`width: 32px; height: 32px;` sets the width and height of the avatar.\n\n\n`margin-right: 1.5rem;` adds a right margin to separate the avatar from\nthe message content.\n\n\n\n `.message-content`:\n\n\n`flex: 1 1 auto;` sets the message content to grow and shrink based on\navailable space, occupying the remaining width in the flex container.\n\n\n`position: relative;` establishes a new stacking context for the\nmessage content.\n\n\n`max-width: 100%;` ensures the message content does not exceed the\nwidth of its parent container, which is the message block.\n\n\n\n `.message-content blockquote`:\n\n`max-width: 100%;` ensures the blockquote does not exceed the width of\nits parent container, which is the message content.\n\n\n `.message-content blockquote pre`:\n\n\n`overflow-x: auto;` allows the horizontal scrollbar to appear when the\ncontent of the `&lt;pre&gt;` element overflows its container.\n\n\n`max-width: 100%;` ensures the `&lt;pre&gt;` element does not exceed\nthe width of its parent container, which is the blockquote.\n\n\n\nThe current issue you're facing is that the `&lt;pre&gt;` element is\nextending beyond the conversation container. The issue is caused by the fact\nthat flexbox does not automatically restrict the width of child elements based\non the parent container width.\nTo fix this issue, you can add `min-width: 0;` to the\n`.message-content` class.  This will make sure the flex item's content\ndoes not overflow its container.\n.message-content {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n  vertical-align: top;\n  position: relative;\n  max-width: 100%;\n  min-width: 0; /* Add this property */\n}\n\nBy applying this fix, the `&lt;pre&gt;` element should be restricted to the\nwidth of the conversation container and display a horizontal scrollbar as\nneeded.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhy would a min-width matter for the max-width?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe `min-width` property matters in this context because of how flexbox\nhandles the width of child elements. When you set `flex: 1 1 auto;` on\nthe `.message-content` class, it tells the browser that the element\nshould grow and shrink based on the available space. However, flexbox will not\nautomatically limit the width of the child elements based on the parent\ncontainer width if the child's content is wider than the parent container.\nBy setting `min-width: 0;`, you are explicitly telling the browser that\nthe `.message-content` can have a width as small as 0, effectively\noverriding its natural minimum width determined by the content. This allows the\nflexbox to shrink the `.message-content` when needed, preventing it from\noverflowing the conversation container.\nAs a result, the `max-width: 100%;` on the `.message-content\nblockquote pre` class will now work correctly and prevent the\n`&lt;pre&gt;` element from overflowing its container. The horizontal\nscrollbar will appear as needed when the content of the `&lt;pre&gt;` element\noverflows its container.\nIn summary, adding `min-width: 0;` to the `.message-content` class\nhelps the flexbox handle the width of its child elements correctly, ensuring\nthat the `max-width: 100%;` property on the `&lt;pre&gt;` element works\nas intended.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSee, now THAT fixed the problem.

Asking ChatGPT to explain things\nin step-by-step detail can improve its reasoning and result in better answers.\nWith the width issue solved, the next issue related to indentation in numbered\nlists...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHmm, in a numbered list that Markdown turns into &lt;ol&gt;, the paragraph with the\nnumber gets indented, but the code block and additional paragraphs under the\nsame number aren't indented for the number entry.  How can I fix that?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn order to fix the issue with the indentation of code blocks and additional\nparagraphs inside a numbered list, you can add the following CSS to your\nstylesheet:\nol {\n  counter-reset: list-item;\n}\n\nli {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\nli &gt; * {\n  margin-left: 1.5em;\n}\n\nli::before {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  content: counter(list-item) \".\";\n  counter-increment: list-item;\n  margin-right: 0.5em;\n  text-align: right;\n}\n\nThis CSS will create a custom counter for the list items, apply proper\nindentation to all the elements inside the list items, and place the list item\nnumbers absolutely to the left of the content with correct alignment. This\nshould help keep your code blocks and additional paragraphs indented in line\nwith the first paragraph.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nNo, that just made a mess of the numbering and didn't fix the indentation.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. Let's try another approach to indent the code\nblocks and additional paragraphs under the same number entry in the ordered\nlist.\nAdd the following CSS to your stylesheet:\nol li {\n  padding-left: 1.5em;\n  text-indent: -1.5em;\n}\n\nol li &gt; pre,\nol li &gt; p:not(:first-child) {\n  margin-left: 1.5em;\n}\n\nThis CSS code will indent the list items with a `1.5em` padding and use a\nnegative text-indent to align the list numbers properly. It will also apply the\ncorrect margin to the code blocks and any paragraphs after the first child\nwithin the list items.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThat didn't work either.  It turns out that the Markdown numbering is turning\ninto &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;first paragraph&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;code block&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;second\nparagraph&lt;ol start=\"2\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;second list item&lt;/ol&gt;\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI see the issue now. The code block and the following paragraphs are not within\nthe `&lt;li&gt;` tags, which is causing the indentation problems.\nUnfortunately, this is a limitation of some Markdown parsers when generating\nHTML output. The issue is that the Markdown parser interprets the code block as\na separate element and does not nest it within the `&lt;li&gt;` element.\nOne solution to handle this situation is to use raw HTML for your list items\nwhen you have multiple paragraphs or code blocks within a single list item.\nThis would allow you to manually structure the `&lt;li&gt;` elements so that\nthey contain all the necessary content.\nHere's an example of how you can structure the HTML:\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Code block&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Second list item&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\nIn this example, the code block and the second paragraph are contained within\nthe first `&lt;li&gt;` element, which should maintain proper indentation for\nall elements.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nYes, but then the ``` for the code block won't work inside the HMTL tags. Is\nthere a way to turn the Markdown processing back on inside the tags?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nUnfortunately, you can't switch between Markdown and HTML within the same block\nlike that. However, you can still use the code block in HTML by using the\n`&lt;pre&gt;` and `&lt;code&gt;` tags together, as shown in my previous\nexample.\nHere's a workaround that uses HTML for the list elements and retains the code\nblock:\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;your_code_here\n    another_line_of_code\n    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Second list item&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\nReplace `your_code_here` and `another_line_of_code` with the\nactual code you want to display. While this solution doesn't use the triple\nbackticks, it will still result in a properly formatted code block.\n      \n    \n  \n\nBeing forced to only use HTML just to be able wrap the Markdown output in\n&lt;ol&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags didn't sound good!  But then I had an\nepiphany...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWait, I'm inside HTML tags from the shortcodes.  Maybe if I use shortcodes to\ncreate the HTML tags instead?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, using shortcodes to create the HTML tags can help solve the issue of the\nindentation with the code block and additional paragraphs in your ordered list.\nYou can create shortcodes for the opening and closing `&lt;li&gt;` tags, and\nuse them within your Markdown content.\nHere's an example of how you can create shortcodes for the list items:\n\nCreate a new shortcode file named `li_open.html` in the\n`templates/shortcodes` directory with the following content:\n\n&lt;li&gt;\n\n\nCreate another shortcode file named `li_close.html` in the same\ndirectory with the following content:\n\n&lt;/li&gt;\n\nNow, in your Markdown content, you can use these shortcodes to create the list\nitems:\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  {{ li_open() }}\n    First paragraph\n\n    ```\n    your_code_here\n    another_line_of_code\n    ```\n\n    Second paragraph\n  {{ li_close() }}\n  {{ li_open() }}\n    Second list item\n  {{ li_close() }}\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\nBy using shortcodes to open and close the `&lt;li&gt;` tags, you can continue\nusing the triple backticks for code blocks and preserve the Markdown formatting\nfor your content within the list items.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWon't the &lt;ol&gt; disable the Markdown processing too?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're right, using the `&lt;ol&gt;` tag directly in your Markdown content\nmay cause issues with Markdown processing as well. To address this, you can\ncreate additional shortcodes for the opening and closing `&lt;ol&gt;` tags.\n\nCreate a new shortcode file named `ol_open.html` in the\n`templates/shortcodes` directory with the following content:\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n\n\nCreate another shortcode file named `ol_close.html` in the same\ndirectory with the following content:\n\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\nNow, you can use these shortcodes in your Markdown content like this:\n{{ ol_open() }}\n  {{ li_open() }}\n    First paragraph\n\n    ```\n    your_code_here\n    another_line_of_code\n    ```\n\n    Second paragraph\n  {{ li_close() }}\n  {{ li_open() }}\n    Second list item\n  {{ li_close() }}\n{{ ol_close() }}\n\nBy using shortcodes for both the `&lt;ol&gt;` and `&lt;li&gt;` tags,\nMarkdown processing should work correctly within the list items.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nYup, that works perfectly, though the {{&nbsp;li_close()&nbsp;}} isn't needed.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI'm glad to hear that it works! Yes, you're right. Since the `&lt;/li&gt;`\nclosing tag is optional in HTML, you can omit the {{&nbsp;li_close()&nbsp;}}\nshortcode, and the browser will automatically close the `&lt;li&gt;` tags for\nyou.  Here's the revised version without the {{&nbsp;li_close()&nbsp;}} shortcode:\n{{ ol_open() }}\n  {{ li_open() }}\n    First paragraph\n\n    ```\n    your_code_here\n    another_line_of_code\n    ```\n\n    Second paragraph\n  {{ li_open() }}\n    Second list item\n{{ ol_close() }}\n\nThis should still work correctly and maintain proper Markdown processing within\nthe list items.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis technique is much more workable.  In addition to removing the\n{{&nbsp;li_close()&nbsp;}} shortcode because &lt;/li&gt; is optional in HTML, I also\nrenamed {{&nbsp;li_open()&nbsp;}} to {{&nbsp;li()&nbsp;}} for simplicity.  I also added\ncorresponding {{&nbsp;ul_open()&nbsp;}} and {{&nbsp;ul_close()&nbsp;}} shortcodes for\nunordered lists.\nAfter this, I discussed the DeepThought theme's SASS file with ChatGPT, and how\nto make the navigation bar stay in a fixed position at the top of the screen...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nConsider this \"_navbar.sass\" file used by the DeepThought theme:\n[Here I copied and pasted the SASS file in question.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThis `_navbar.sass` file appears to be a SASS (Syntactically Awesome\nStyle Sheets) file containing styling rules for the navigation bar of the\nDeepThought theme. SASS is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features\nlike variables, nested rules, and mixins.\nThe file starts by importing mixins and defining a set of variables related to\nthe navigation bar, such as colors, dimensions, and breakpoints. These\nvariables can be customized to change the appearance of the navigation bar.\nThe file then defines a series of styling rules for various elements and states\nof the navigation bar, such as the navbar brand, tabs, menu, items, links,\ndropdowns, and dividers. These rules cover different device sizes and screen\norientations through the use of media queries.\nIn general, this file contains the core styling of the navigation bar for the\nDeepThought theme and can be customized to fit the specific needs of a project.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWithout adding any custom CSS rules of my own, how can I use the rules in that\nSASS file to keep the navbar in a fixed position instead of scrolling off the\nscreen?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo keep the navbar in a fixed position without adding any custom CSS rules, you\ncan leverage Bootstrap's built-in class for this purpose. Since you are using\nSASS and assuming you have already imported the Bootstrap SASS file, all you\nneed to do is add the `.fixed-top` class to your navbar element in the\nHTML markup. This will make the navbar fixed at the top of the page without\nwriting any additional CSS.\nHere's how you can do it:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Make sure to include the compiled CSS from your SASS file --&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"your_compiled_css_file.css\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Add the .fixed-top class to your navbar element --&gt;\n  &lt;nav class=\"navbar navbar-expand-lg fixed-top\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Your navbar content goes here --&gt;\n  &lt;/nav&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Your page content goes here --&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nBy adding the `.fixed-top` class to your navbar, it will remain fixed at\nthe top of the viewport when the user scrolls down the page.\n      \n    \n  \n\nBootstrap??  ChatGPT is making random assumptions again!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhy are you assuming Bootstrap?  I just gave you the SASS file DeepThought uses\nfor the navbar.  Give an answer based ONLY on that file.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for the confusion. Based on the provided SASS file, you can make the\nnavbar fixed by using the existing styles. Here's how you can do it:\n\n\nFirst, locate the class name that is being used for the navbar in your HTML\nfile. For this example, let's assume the class name is\n`.deepthought-navbar`.\n\n\nIn the SASS file you provided, add a new style rule for the\n`.deepthought-navbar` class to make it fixed at the top:\n\n\n.deepthought-navbar {\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  z-index: 1030;\n}\n\nThese styles will ensure that the navbar has a fixed position at the top of the\npage, covers the full width of the viewport, and has a z-index high enough to\nappear above most other elements on the page.\n\n\nCompile the SASS file to generate the updated CSS file.\n\n\nMake sure the updated CSS file is linked in your HTML file.\n\n\nNow, the navbar should remain fixed at the top of the viewport when you scroll\ndown the page.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI said without adding custom styles.  Only use classes and styles already\ndefined in the provided SASS file.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nApologies for misunderstanding your request earlier. Unfortunately, the\nprovided SASS file does not have any existing styles to create a fixed navbar\nwithout adding any custom styles. If you cannot add custom styles, you will\nneed to rely on external libraries or frameworks that have built-in support for\nfixed navbars, or consider modifying the SASS file to include the necessary\nstyles for a fixed navbar as mentioned in the previous response.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOh really??  That's funny, because I see one!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat does \"is-fixed-top\" do in that SASS file?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for my earlier oversight. Indeed, there is a class in the provided\nSASS file called \"is-fixed-top\". This class can be used to create a fixed-top\nnavbar.\nThe \"is-fixed-top\" class sets the position of the element to \"fixed\", with a\n\"top\" value of 0, and a \"z-index\" value of 30. This ensures that the navbar\nwill stay at the top of the page and not scroll off the screen, while appearing\nabove most other content on the page.\nTo use this class, simply add the \"is-fixed-top\" class to your navbar HTML\nelement:\n&lt;nav class=\"navbar is-fixed-top\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Your navbar content goes here --&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n\nThis should keep the navbar in a fixed position at the top of the page, without\nneeding to add any custom styles.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis is a simple solution that works.  However, it didn't work in the theme's\ndark mode, even though I was using a CSS rule that was provided by the theme\nitself!  Diving into this topic turned out to be a VERY deep rabbit hole...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nNow, I've already done that, and it works...  until I switch the theme to dark\nmode, then it stops working.  Why?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion earlier. I see that you are experiencing an issue\nwhen switching to dark mode. The issue could be related to the `.is-dark`\nclass in the SASS file provided. It's possible that the styles for the\n`.is-dark` class might be interfering with the `.is-fixed-top`\nclass.\nTo identify the issue, please check if the `.is-dark` class (or any other\nclass related to dark mode) is causing any style conflicts or overrides with\nthe `.is-fixed-top` class. Look for any CSS properties that might be\naffecting the positioning or display of the fixed-top navbar in dark mode.\nIf you can provide more information about the specific styles applied in dark\nmode or any relevant code, I would be happy to help further troubleshoot the\nissue.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt has to be interaction with these [theme=\"dark\"] selectors in the \"deep-thought.sass\" file:\n@charset \"utf-8\"\n\n// Import a Google Font\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800;1,900&amp;display=swap')\n\n// Update Bulma's global variables\n$family-sans-serif: \"Jost\", sans-serif\n$footer-padding: 1.0rem 2.5rem\n\nhtml\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scroll-behavior: smooth\n\nbody\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: $family-sans-serif\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flex-direction: column\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;min-height: 100vh\n\n\nbody[theme=\"dark\"]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)\n\n\nsection\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1\n\n\nimg[theme=\"dark\"],\npicture[theme=\"dark\"],\nvideo[theme=\"dark\"],\npre[theme=\"dark\"]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)\n\n@import \"utilities/_all\"\n@import \"base/_all\"\n@import \"elements/_all\"\n@import \"form/_all\"\n@import \"components/_all\"\n@import \"grid/_all\"\n@import \"helpers/_all\"\n@import \"layout/_all\"\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThank you for providing the relevant code. I see that the issue seems to be\ncaused by the following CSS rule in the \"deep-thought.sass\" file:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"]\n    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)\n\nWhen the theme is switched to dark mode, this rule is applied to the entire\n`body` element, inverting the colors and rotating the hue by 180 degrees.\nHowever, this also affects child elements, such as the navbar with the\n`.is-fixed-top` class. The filter applied to the `body` element\nmight be causing the fixed positioning of the navbar to stop working as\nintended.\nTo resolve this issue, you can either:\n\n\nModify the dark theme styles to apply the filter individually to specific\nelements, instead of applying it to the entire `body` element. This\nwill help ensure that the filter does not interfere with the fixed positioning\nof the navbar.\n\n\nAdd a new rule targeting the navbar specifically in dark mode to counteract\nthe filter applied to the `body` element. This rule should apply the\nopposite filter to the navbar, essentially canceling out the filter applied to\nthe `body`. For example:\n\n\n.is-fixed-top[theme=\"dark\"]\n    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)\n\nThis rule will apply the same filter to the fixed-top navbar when the theme is\nset to dark, counteracting the filter applied to the `body` element and\npreserving the navbar's fixed positioning.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOff on the wrong track again!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI'm not trying to cancel out the dark mode, I'm trying to keep the\n\"is-fixed-top\" style working.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. After reviewing the provided code, it seems that\nthe dark mode styles should not be directly affecting the `.is-fixed-top`\nclass behavior. The filter applied to the `body` element when the theme\nis set to dark shouldn't affect the positioning of the navbar.\nHowever, there might be an issue with how the dark mode is being applied in the\nHTML structure or JavaScript implementation. To help identify the problem,\nplease provide the relevant HTML and JavaScript code used for switching between\nthe light and dark modes.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt might be in here:\nfunction documentReadyCallback() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;[Here I copied and pasted this JavaScript function.]\n};\n\nif (document.readyState === 'loading') {  // Loading hasn't finished yet\n&nbsp;&nbsp;document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', documentReadyCallback);\n} else {  // `DOMContentLoaded` has already fired\n&nbsp;&nbsp;documentReadyCallback();\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBased on the code provided, it seems that when the theme is switched to dark\nmode, the following styles are applied:\ndocument.body.setAttribute(\"theme\", \"dark\");\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"img, picture, video, pre\").forEach(img =&gt; img.setAttribute(\"theme\", \"dark\"));\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\".vimeo, .youtube, .chart\").forEach(video =&gt; video.setAttribute(\"theme\", \"dark\"));\n\nThese lines add the `theme=\"dark\"` attribute to the body, images,\npicture, video, and pre elements, as well as to elements with the class names\n\"vimeo\", \"youtube\", and \"chart\".\nHowever, the provided code doesn't directly interact with the `.is-fixed-top\nclass`, and the dark mode styles from the \"deep-thought.sass\" file should\nnot affect the navbar's fixed positioning.\nIf the navbar stops being fixed in the dark mode, there might be an issue\noutside of the provided code. It is also possible that some other styles or\nscripts are affecting the behavior. To further investigate, please check the\nbrowser's developer tools (like the Elements and Styles panels in Google\nChrome) to inspect the styles applied to the navbar when the theme is switched\nto dark mode. This might help identify any unexpected styles that could be\ncausing the issue.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHere are the HTML elements in dark mode:\n[Here I copied and pasted the relevant HTML.]\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBased on the provided HTML code, the navbar has the `is-fixed-top` and\n`is-light` classes applied to it. When you switch to dark mode, the\nfollowing styles from the \"deep-thought.sass\" file are applied to the body:\nbody[theme=\"dark\"] {\n    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\n\nHowever, this filter should not affect the fixed positioning of the navbar. As\npreviously mentioned, the provided code doesn't directly interact with the\n`.is-fixed-top` class, and the dark mode styles should not affect the\nnavbar's fixed positioning.\nTo help you debug this issue, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n\nInspect the navbar element in your browser's developer tools when in dark\nmode. Check the applied styles and see if any styles conflict with the fixed\npositioning.\n\n\nTemporarily disable the dark mode JavaScript code and see if the issue\npersists. This will help you determine if the issue is related to the dark\nmode code or not.\n\n\nIf the issue still persists after trying these steps, it might be necessary to\nlook at other parts of your code or stylesheets that could be affecting the\nfixed positioning of the navbar in dark mode.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhen I click on that top-level &lt;nav&gt; element, it does say the computed style\nis \"position: fixed\".  However, at the next level down in &lt;div\nclass=\"container\"&gt;, it says \"position: relative\" and points to this\n\"deep-thought.css\" rule:\n\n\n.container {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flex-grow: 1;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0 auto;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position: relative;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width: auto\n}\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe `position: relative` style on the `.container` div should not\nbe causing the issue with the fixed positioning of the navbar. A `position:\nrelative` style on a child element does not affect the positioning of the\nparent element. In this case, the parent element is the `&lt;nav&gt;` element\nwith the `is-fixed-top` class.\nHowever, if you still suspect that the `position: relative` style on the\n`.container` div is causing the issue, you can try overriding it for the\nspecific case of the navbar container. Add the following custom CSS rule to\nyour stylesheet:\n.navbar.is-fixed-top .container {\n    position: static;\n}\n\nThis CSS rule targets the `.container` div that is a child of a\n`.navbar.is-fixed-top` element and sets its position to `static`,\nwhich is the default value.\nPlease note that this custom CSS rule may not be necessary, as the\n`position: relative` style on the `.container` div should not cause\nissues with the fixed positioning of the parent `&lt;nav&gt;` element.\nHowever, you can try this rule to see if it resolves the issue you are\nexperiencing.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIf the &lt;nav&gt; element was computed as \"fixed\", what else could be overriding\nthat?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf the `&lt;nav&gt;` element's computed position is `fixed`, it is\nunlikely that the issue is caused by the positioning itself. However, other\nfactors may be causing the navbar to behave unexpectedly. Here are a few\npossibilities to consider:\n\n\n z-index: The navbar might be positioned correctly, but it could\nbe hidden behind other elements on the page due to a lower z-index. Check if\nthere are any elements with higher z-index values that could be overlapping the\nnavbar. You can try setting a higher z-index value for the navbar to ensure it\nstays on top of other elements:\n.navbar.is-fixed-top {\n    z-index: 1000; /* or any sufficiently high value */\n}\n\n\n Dark mode filter: The dark mode filter applied to the\n`body` element might be causing some unexpected behavior. It uses\n`filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)`, which could lead to odd visual\neffects in some cases. Try disabling the filter temporarily to see if the issue\npersists.\n\n JavaScript interference: Some JavaScript code on your page might\nbe interfering with the navbar's behavior. Review your JavaScript code and\ndisable any scripts temporarily to see if the issue still occurs. If you find\nthe problematic script, you can further investigate and modify it to ensure it\ndoesn't affect the navbar.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it would be helpful to have a live example or\na more detailed description of the issue you are experiencing. This would allow\nfor more accurate troubleshooting and guidance.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI found the following documentation on\nhttps://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/#fixed-navbar\nFixed navbar#\nYou can now fix the navbar to either the top or bottom of the page. This is a\n2-step process:\nAdd either is-fixed-top or is-fixed-bottom to the navbar component\n&lt;nav class=\"navbar is-fixed-top\"&gt;\nAdd the corresponding has-navbar-fixed-top or has-navbar-fixed-bottom modifier\nto either  or  element to provide the appropriate padding to the\npage\n&lt;html class=\"has-navbar-fixed-top\"&gt;\nTry it out!\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for not mentioning this earlier. You're right, Bulma does have\nbuilt-in support for fixed navbars. Following the two-step process described in\nthe documentation should solve the issue:\n\nAdd `is-fixed-top` to the `&lt;nav&gt;` element, which you've\nalready done:\n\n&lt;nav aria-label=\"section navigation\" class=\"navbar is-fixed-top is-light\" role=\"navigation\"&gt;\n\n\nAdd the `has-navbar-fixed-top` class to the `&lt;html&gt;` or\n`&lt;body&gt;` element:\n\n&lt;html class=\"has-navbar-fixed-top\"&gt;\n\nThe `has-navbar-fixed-top` class provides the necessary padding to\nprevent content from being hidden behind the fixed navbar when scrolling. This\nshould work as expected, even when switching between light and dark modes.\nMake sure to include the Bulma CSS in your project for these classes to work.\nIf the issue persists, please let me know and provide more details about the\nproblem you are facing.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nDeepThought says it's based on Bulma.  I added the \"has-navbar-fixed-top\" to\nthe &lt;body&gt; tag and that works for the padding, allowing me to remove the\n&lt;div&gt; I had manually added to accomplish the same padding.  Dark mode still\nallows the navbar to scroll off the screen.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThank you for the clarification. Based on the information provided, it appears\nthat the issue lies in the interaction between the dark mode theme and the\nfixed navbar. Since the dark mode is achieved by applying `filter: invert(1)\nhue-rotate(180deg)` to the `body[theme=\"dark\"]` selector in the SASS\nfile, it might be affecting the fixed positioning of the navbar.\nOne possible solution is to separate the navbar from the `body` element\nin the DOM and apply the dark mode filter only to the content container,\nleaving the navbar unaffected. You can modify the HTML structure as follows:\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;nav aria-label=\"section navigation\" class=\"navbar is-fixed-top is-light\" role=\"navigation\"&gt;\n    ...\n  &lt;/nav&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"content-container\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- All other content goes here --&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\nAnd then modify the SASS file to apply the dark mode filter only to the content\ncontainer:\n#content-container[theme=\"dark\"] {\n    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\n}\n\nRemember to update the JavaScript code that sets the \"theme\" attribute for the\ndark mode as well:\nif (localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") === \"dark\") {\n  document.getElementById(\"content-container\").setAttribute(\"theme\", \"dark\");\n  ...\n}\n\nAnd for toggling the dark mode:\ndocument.getElementById(\"dark-mode\").addEventListener(\"click\", () =&gt; {\n  ...\n  if (localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") == \"dark\") {\n    ...\n    document.getElementById(\"content-container\").removeAttribute(\"theme\", \"dark\");\n  } else {\n    ...\n    document.getElementById(\"content-container\").setAttribute(\"theme\", \"dark\");\n  }\n});\n\nThis should prevent the dark mode from affecting the fixed positioning of the\nnavbar while still applying the dark mode theme to the rest of the page\ncontent. If the issue still persists, please let me know so we can investigate\nfurther.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhy would the dark mode have any effect if it's not using \"position\" CSS rules?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou are correct that the dark mode styles don't directly use \"position\" CSS\nrules. However, the `filter` property applied to the\n`body[theme=\"dark\"]` selector may still have unintended side effects when\ncombined with other styles, such as `position: fixed`.\nUpon further investigation, it seems that the issue is likely not related to\nthe dark mode styles themselves, but rather to the stacking context of the\nelements on the page. The `filter` property creates a new stacking\ncontext, which can cause the fixed-position navbar to be positioned relative to\nthe filtered body element instead of the viewport.\nTo resolve this issue, you can add a high `z-index` value to the\n`.navbar` class in your SASS file to ensure that the navbar is always\nrendered on top of other elements, regardless of the stacking context:\n.navbar {\n  z-index: 9999; // You can adjust this value as needed\n}\n\nAdding the `z-index` property should help to ensure that the fixed navbar\nstays in place when the dark mode is active. Please try this solution and let\nme know if it resolves the issue.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt already had a z-index of 30, was that insufficient?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nA `z-index` of 30 should generally be sufficient to keep the navbar on\ntop of other elements on the page. However, if there are other elements with a\nhigher `z-index` value or if the stacking context is affected by other\nCSS properties (such as the `filter` property in the dark mode), it's\npossible that a higher `z-index` value might be required.\nYou can try increasing the `z-index` value for the `.navbar` class\nto see if that resolves the issue. However, it's also possible that there might\nbe another underlying cause for the scrolling issue in dark mode.\nIf increasing the `z-index` value doesn't resolve the issue, please let\nme know so we can continue investigating the problem.\n      \n    \n  \n\nGoogle searches turned up a discussion about a similar issue and the problem\ndoes appear to be caused by the creation of a new stacking context by the\nfilter.  However, it also appears to be a very difficult issue to resolve, so I\ndecided to just leave it broken for now.\nNext, I shifted to discussing how to use GitHub Pages for free hosting...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHow would I need to setup the git repositories to host codereflections.com on\nGitHub Pages?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHosting a website on GitHub Pages is fairly straightforward. Here's the\nstep-by-step process:\n\n\nCreate a GitHub account if you don't have one already.\n\n\nCreate a new repository. The repository should be named in the format\n`username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your GitHub\nusername. For example, if your username is `codereflections`, you would\ncreate a repository named `codereflections.github.io`.\n\n\nPush your website's files to this new repository. Your HTML files, CSS,\nJavaScript, images, etc., should all be pushed to this repository. Note that\nGitHub Pages uses the main branch as the publishing source for your site.\n\n\nAccess your website. Once you've pushed your website's files to the\n`username.github.io` repository, your website should be accessible at\n`https://username.github.io`.\n\n\nTo use a custom domain like `codereflections.com`, follow these\nadditional steps:\n\n\nPurchase a domain name. You can purchase a domain name from a domain name\nregistrar such as Google Domains, Namecheap, or GoDaddy.\n\n\nConfigure your domain. You'll need to add a CNAME file to your GitHub\nrepository and configure the DNS settings with your domain name registrar to\npoint to GitHub's servers. The CNAME file should contain only the domain name\n`codereflections.com` and nothing else. In your DNS settings, you would\nadd a CNAME record for the www subdomain pointing to\n`username.github.io`, and four A records for the apex domain pointing to\nthe IP addresses provided by GitHub.\n\n\nMore details on these steps can be found in the GitHub Pages documentation:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/pages\nRemember that GitHub Pages is intended for static websites. If your website\nuses server-side code (like PHP or Node.js), it won't work on GitHub Pages. In\nthat case, you would need to look into different hosting options such as\nHeroku, Vercel, or Netlify.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIn this case, the username on GitHub is \"code-reflections\" because of the\nnamesquatter on \"codereflections\".\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf your username on GitHub is `code-reflections`, then you would create a\nrepository named `code-reflections.github.io`.\nHere's the updated step-by-step process:\n\n\nCreate a GitHub account if you don't have one already. You already have an\naccount named `code-reflections`.\n\n\nCreate a new repository. The repository should be named\n`code-reflections.github.io`.\n\n\nPush your website's files to this new repository. Your HTML files, CSS,\nJavaScript, images, etc., should all be pushed to this repository. Note that\nGitHub Pages uses the main branch as the publishing source for your site.\n\n\nAccess your website. Once you've pushed your website's files to the\n`code-reflections.github.io` repository, your website should be\naccessible at `https://code-reflections.github.io`.\n\n\nTo use a custom domain like `codereflections.com`, follow these\nadditional steps:\n\n\nPurchase a domain name. You can purchase a domain name from a domain name\nregistrar such as Google Domains, Namecheap, or GoDaddy.\n\n\nConfigure your domain. You'll need to add a CNAME file to your GitHub\nrepository and configure the DNS settings with your domain name registrar to\npoint to GitHub's servers. The CNAME file should contain only the domain name\n`codereflections.com` and nothing else. In your DNS settings, you would\nadd a CNAME record for the www subdomain pointing to\n`code-reflections.github.io`, and four A records for the apex domain\npointing to the IP addresses provided by GitHub.\n\n\nThis will allow your site to be accessed via `codereflections.com`\ninstead of `code-reflections.github.io`.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nShould the files be in the \"main\" branch or another branch?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nFor a user or organization page (like `code-reflections.github.io`), the\nfiles should be on the `main` branch. This is because, by default, GitHub\nPages uses the `main` branch for publishing your website.\nHowever, for project pages, you have the option to use either the `main`\nbranch, the `gh-pages` branch, or the `/docs` folder on the\n`main` branch.\nSince you are creating a user page, stick with the `main` branch. Just\nmake sure your primary HTML file is named `index.html` as this is what\nGitHub Pages will look to serve as the root of your site.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI realized that getting Zola to play nicely with Git was going to be tricky,\nbecause Zola always blows away the \"public\" directory when building the site,\nbut I wanted that directory to be a Git submodule.  I'll save that part of the\nstory for the next post.\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/08/05/wrapping-up-the-origin-story/","title":"Wrapping up the origin story."},"https://codereflections.com/2023/12/23/using-git-submodules-with-zola/":{"body":"[I started working on this blog post back in September, but I had to set it\naside for months due to other priorities and distractions.  Now it's nearly\nChristmas!!  Oh well.]\nWhen I created this blog, I wanted to use one Git repository for the Markdown\nsource files and a separate Git repository for the files generated by Zola, the\nstatic site generator that I was using.  This is harder than it sounds, because\nZola automatically deletes the entire output directory at the start of its\nbuild process, including the public/.git file that identifies the public\noutput directory as a Git submodule.  Read on for the story of how I came up\nwith a solution for this chicken-and-egg problem...\nThe Goal\nHere's what I wanted:\n\n\nA top-level Git repository containing only the source for this website,\nincluding the content Markdown files, static files, template changes, Zola\nshortcodes, etc.\n\n\nA separate Git repository, compatible with GitHub Pages, containing all the\nauto-generated files in the public directory created by the zola build\ncommand.\n\n\nTo be able to use the repository of auto-generated files as a Git submodule\nunder the top-level Git repository.\n\n\nAn easy-to-use process with no unnecessary manual steps required.\n\n\nSounds straightforward, right?\nThe Problem\n\n\nRunning zola build automatically deletes the entire public directory as\nthe first step of the build process, then regenerates the entire site from\nscratch.\n\n\nDeleting the public directory discards the public/.git file used by Git\nto identify the public subdirectory as a Git submodule.\n\n\nOther static files like LICENSE and README.md can easily be recreated by\nplacing them in the static directory, and zola build will copy those\nfiles back into the public directory during the build process.\n\n\nThis technique doesn't work so well for the public/.git file.  Copying it\ninto the static directory just confuses Git into thinking that static is\na Git submodule directory.  It's not!\n\n\nGit also refuses to commit static/.git into the top-level repository as a\nplain repository file, because it assumes that the .git path name must\nbe Git metadata, not a normal file in the repository.\n\n\nTL;DR\nNote: The following conversation with ChatGPT is VERY long —\nclick here to just skip to the solution!\nThe ChatGPT Conversation\nPicking up the ChatGPT conversation where my last\npost left off, we were in the\nmiddle of discussing how to use GitHub Pages to host the site for free:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nShould the website files be at the root of the repository?  I'm creating a\nseparate \"codereflections\" repository for the Zola source files and I figured I\nshould checkout the \"code-reflections.github.io\" repository as a git submodule\ninside the \"codereflections\" repository, checked out as \"public\" so Zola will\ngenerate the site files there.  How do I keep Zola from clobbering the initial\nLICENSE and README.md files?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, for a GitHub Pages website, the website files should be at the root of the\nrepository. Your plan to use a separate repository for the Zola source files\nand to include the `code-reflections.github.io` repository as a git\nsubmodule is a good one.\nAs for preventing Zola from overwriting the LICENSE and README.md files, you\ncan do this by configuring Zola to ignore these files when generating the site.\nZola does not have a built-in functionality to ignore specific files during\nbuild. However, you can work around this by writing a shell script or makefile\nthat moves these files to a temporary location before running `zola\nbuild`, then moves them back afterwards.\nHere is a simple example of a shell script that does this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Move the files to a temporary location\nmv public/LICENSE temp_LICENSE\nmv public/README.md temp_README.md\n\n# Run Zola build\nzola build\n\n# Move the files back\nmv temp_LICENSE public/LICENSE\nmv temp_README.md public/README.md\n\nYou can run this script each time you want to generate the site with Zola. This\nway, the LICENSE and README.md files will be preserved in your `public`\ndirectory.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nCan I just add the LICENSE and READMEmd files under the \"static\" directory so\nZola would \"generate\" them into the \"public\" directory?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, that's actually a very straightforward and effective solution! Any files\nyou place in Zola's `static` directory will be copied over to the\n`public` directory as-is when you run `zola build`. This is\ndesigned specifically for files that don't need to be processed by Zola, like\nimages, scripts, or in your case, the LICENSE and README.md files.\nSo you can indeed put your LICENSE and README.md files in the `static`\ndirectory of your Zola project, and they will be included in the `public`\ndirectory each time you generate your site. This way, you can ensure they are\nalways present in the `public` directory without having to manually move\nthem around or use a script.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI just realized I also needed to copy the \".git\" file from the submodule\ndirectory into the \"static\" directory.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nCopying the \".git\" directory into the \"static\" directory may not be the best\nidea. Here's why:\nThe \".git\" directory contains all of the version control information for your\nproject, and it's typically hidden and not meant to be moved or manipulated\ndirectly. It contains a lot of data and metadata that's crucial to the\noperation of Git, and moving or copying it around can potentially cause issues\nwith your version control.\nFurthermore, this directory can become quite large, especially for larger\nprojects with a long history of changes. Including it in your website's static\nfiles will significantly increase the size of your website, and it will be\ndownloaded by anyone who clones your repository.\nInstead of copying the \".git\" directory, I would suggest the following\nalternatives:\n\n\nAdd the files you want to keep (like LICENSE and README.md) to the \"static\"\ndirectory in Zola, as you've already done. This will ensure they are included\nin the \"public\" directory each time you generate your site.\n\n\nKeep the \".git\" directory where it is in your project's root directory. If\nyou want to include the version control history in your website, consider\nproviding a link to the GitHub repository instead.\n\n\nIf you need to include some version control metadata in your site (like the\nlatest commit hash or commit date), consider using a script that extracts\nthis information from the \".git\" directory and includes it in your site during\nthe build process. There are many ways to do this, and the best approach will\ndepend on your specific needs and the tools you're comfortable with.\n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\nSigh.  This was a stupid answer, because \".git\" in the submodule directory is\njust a FILE, as I mentioned in my question.  Time to walk ChatGPT through it,\nyet again...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat does .git contain in the SUBMODULE directory?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe `.git` file (not directory) in a submodule is different from the\n`.git` directory at the root of a typical git repository. This file is a\ntext file that contains a path to the actual git directory for the submodule,\nwhich is stored in the parent project's `.git/modules` directory.\nHere's an example of what you might see in a `.git` file for a submodule:\ngitdir: ../.git/modules/my-submodule\n\nThis line tells Git that the git directory for this submodule is located at the\nspecified path relative to the submodule's root directory.\nIt's important to note that this `.git` file is a critical part of how\nGit manages submodules. If it's removed or altered incorrectly, it can disrupt\nthe connection between the submodule and the parent repository. This is why\nit's generally recommended to not manually modify or move this file.\nSo, when you mentioned copying the `.git` file into the `static`\ndirectory, this could potentially disrupt the Git submodule functionality. As\nmentioned earlier, it would be better to handle files you want to appear in the\npublic directory separately, rather than trying to manipulate the Git\ninternals.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nNow do you see why I needed to copy that FILE into \"static\"?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAh, I see what you're getting at now. You're trying to ensure that the\nsubmodule's `.git` file gets included when Zola generates the site, so\nthat the `public` directory is still recognized as a Git repository (in\nthis case, the repository for your GitHub Pages site).\nHowever, there's an important thing to note here: the `.git` file in a\nsubmodule doesn't contain the full Git repository data. It's just a pointer to\nthe actual repository data, which is stored in the parent project's\n`.git/modules` directory. If you copy the `.git` file without the\naccompanying repository data, it won't be able to function as intended.\nThere's also another problem with this approach: Zola (and many other static\nsite generators) are designed to ignore `.git` directories/files when\ngenerating the site, because these files aren't intended to be part of the site\ncontent.\nA better approach might be to use a script or makefile to automate the process\nof building the site with Zola, committing the changes to the `public`\nsubmodule, and pushing the changes to GitHub. This would allow you to keep the\nsource files and generated site in separate repositories, without having to\nmanipulate the Git internals.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI copied the submodule's \".git\" file into the \"static\" directory.  It works\nperfectly.  I can even \"rm -rf public\" and then \"zola build\" and the submodule\nstill works fine because the actual git files are in the top-level .git\ndirectory.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for misunderstanding your original question. You're correct that\nthe `.git` file in a submodule is a pointer to the actual Git directory\nstored in the `.git/modules/` directory of the superproject. By copying\nthe `.git` file to the `static` directory, you're ensuring that\nthis pointer is included when Zola generates the site. This means that the\n`public` directory will still function as a Git repository after you run\n`zola build`, even if the original `public` directory was removed.\nIt's good to hear that this approach is working for you. Just remember that\nthis is a somewhat unconventional use of Git submodules and may not be\nimmediately obvious to others who might work with your project in the future.\nIt might be a good idea to document this setup somewhere in your project.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThis worked great for the submodule.  Unfortunately, adding a new \".git\" file\nin the \"static\" subdirectory confused Git in the top-level repository, making\nit think that \"static\" was a Git submodule.  But it's not!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs this going to be a problem?  The submodule works great, but when I do \"git\nadd static\" in the top-level repo, it gives me this warning:\nwarning: adding embedded git repository: static\nhint: You've added another git repository inside your current repository.\nhint: Clones of the outer repository will not contain the contents of\nhint: the embedded repository and will not know how to obtain it.\nhint: If you meant to add a submodule, use:\nhint:\nhint:   git submodule add  static\nhint:\nhint: If you added this path by mistake, you can remove it from the\nhint: index with:\nhint:\nhint:   git rm --cached static\nhint:\nhint: See \"git help submodule\" for more information.\n\nI'm hoping this will still just work, since it says warning.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe warning you're seeing is Git's way of telling you that you're adding a Git\nrepository within another Git repository, which is generally not recommended\nbecause it can lead to confusing behavior.\nHowever, in your specific case, you're not actually adding a full Git\nrepository, but just the `.git` file that points to the submodule's\nrepository data stored in the `.git/modules` directory of the parent\nrepository. This is a somewhat unusual setup, but as you've seen, it does work.\nThe warning is there to help prevent people from accidentally adding full Git\nrepositories (with their own separate `.git` directories and repository\ndata) into their projects when they intended to add a submodule. In your case,\nthe warning can safely be ignored.\nWhen you commit and push your changes, the `.git` file in the\n`static` directory will be included, but the actual repository data for\nthe submodule (stored in the `.git/modules` directory) will not be. This\nis fine, because the repository data will be fetched from the submodule's\nremote repository when someone clones your repository and initializes the\nsubmodule.\nSo in short, this warning can be ignored in your specific case, but do remember\nto document this setup somewhere for the benefit of anyone else who might work\non this project in the future.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAfter doing \"git add .\", here is what \"git status\" shows:\nOn branch main\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\n(use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n\nChanges to be committed:\n(use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\nnew file:   config.toml\nnew file:   content/_index.md\nnew file:   static\nnew file:   templates/base.html\nnew file:   templates/index.html\nnew file:   templates/robots.txt\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n(use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n(use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n(commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)\nmodified:   public (modified content)\nmodified:   static (modified content)\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBased on the output you've provided, you have several files that are staged to\nbe committed (config.toml, content/_index.md, static, templates/base.html,\ntemplates/index.html, templates/robots.txt). This means that these files'\nchanges have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed to\nthe repository.\nHowever, it also shows that there are changes in two directories (public and\nstatic) that are not staged for commit. These directories are submodules, as\nindicated by the \"(commit or discard the untracked or modified content in\nsubmodules)\" message.\nYou have two options to handle these changes:\n\n\n Go into each submodule directory, add and commit the changes there,\nthen come back to the parent repository, add and commit the new submodule\nstate.  This is the standard way of managing changes in submodules:\ncd public\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Commit in public submodule\"\ncd ..\ncd static\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Commit in static submodule\"\ncd ..\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Commit in parent repository\"\n\n\n\n\n If you don't want to keep the changes in the submodules, you can\ndiscard them:\ncd public\ngit checkout .\ncd ..\ncd static\ngit checkout .\ncd ..\n\nThe \"git checkout .\" command will discard any changes in the current directory.\nBe careful with this command, as it cannot be undone.\n\nOnce you've either committed or discarded the changes in the submodules, you\nshould be able to commit in the parent repository without any warnings or\nmessages about changes in the submodules.\n      \n    \n  \n\nMore ChatGPT stupidity...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThink about that.  What is \"static\" really?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIn the context of a static site generator like Zola, the \"static\" directory is\nusually where you would place files that you want to be served exactly as they\nare, without any processing by the static site generator. This often includes\nfiles like images, CSS and JavaScript files, and other assets that don't need\nto be processed or templated.\nIn your case, it seems that you're using the \"static\" directory somewhat\ndifferently. You have copied the `.git` file of your submodule into the\n\"static\" directory so that it gets copied over to the \"public\" directory during\nthe Zola build process. This allows you to maintain the Git connection in your\n\"public\" directory, which is the output of the Zola build and also a submodule\nitself.\nSo, in your specific setup, the \"static\" directory is serving a dual role -\nit's both a place for static files to be copied over during the build, and also\na way to maintain the Git connection in your output directory. This is a\nsomewhat unique setup, but if it's working for your needs, then it's a creative\nsolution!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nNow, how do I convince git to just check in \"static/.git\" as a regular file and\nNOT treat it as a submodule?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe `.git` file in a repository is not intended to be tracked as a\nregular file. It contains the metadata and the entire history of your\nrepository. Checking it in as a regular file could lead to unexpected behavior,\nand Git is designed to prevent this.\nIf you are trying to include some Git-related information in your repository as\na static file, there are other ways to do this that don't involve including the\n`.git` file itself. For example, you could create a script that generates\na text file with the current commit hash, and check in that file.\nHowever, your usage case seems to be very unique where you're trying to\nmaintain a Git connection in your \"public\" directory, which is the output of\nthe Zola build and also a submodule itself. If you insist on keeping the\n`.git` as a static file, I'd recommend renaming it to something else like\n`.gitinfo` or similar. Git recognizes `.git` as a special directory\nfor repository information, so changing the name should help you avoid Git's\nprotections against tracking this directory.\nKeep in mind though, this is not a standard practice and could lead to\nunexpected behaviors, especially if other users or systems interact with your\nrepository expecting standard Git behavior.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\"git add static/.git\" gives this error:\nfatal: Pathspec 'static/.git' is in submodule 'static'\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThis error occurs because Git is trying to prevent you from doing something\npotentially dangerous. In this case, you're trying to add a Git directory\n(`.git`) from a submodule (`static`), which Git is designed to\nprevent.\nAs mentioned earlier, the `.git` directory is special as it contains all\nthe metadata for your Git repository, including commit history, branches, and\nconfiguration information. It's not a regular directory or file and you\nshouldn't try to add it to your Git repository as if it were.\nInstead, if you want to keep track of changes in a submodule, you should commit\nchanges within the submodule itself and then commit the new state of the\nsubmodule in the main repository.\nIn your case, since you're using the `public` directory as a submodule,\nthe recommended workflow would be:\n\n\nMake changes in your main repository (but not within `public`)\n\n\nRun `zola build` to update the `public` directory\n\n\nChange to the `public` directory and commit the changes there\n\n\nChange back to your main directory and commit the new state of the\n`public` submodule\n\n\nThis will ensure that the submodule's history is correctly tracked in its own\nseparate repository, while still allowing you to keep track of its overall\nstate in the main repository.\nRemember, treating `.git` directory as a static file and trying to\nversion control it is against the core principles of how Git is designed to\nwork and can lead to unwanted and unexpected consequences.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAgain, in this case, \"static\" is NOT a submodule, it just resembles one.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf \"static\" is not a submodule but a regular directory in your repository, you\ncan add files within it to your repository using `git add\nstatic/&lt;filename&gt;`. However, the `.git` file (not directory) within\nthe \"static\" directory that refers to the submodule might be causing confusion.\nIn normal circumstances, you shouldn't be manually creating or copying a\n`.git` file. That's something Git handles automatically when you clone a\nrepository or initialize a new one. If you have manually copied the\n`.git` file into the \"static\" directory, Git may be getting confused and\ntreating the \"static\" directory as a submodule, hence the error.\nIf you're certain that \"static\" should not be treated as a submodule, you might\nconsider removing the `.git` file from the \"static\" directory. However,\nbe aware that this could disrupt the connection between the submodule and the\nmain repository if \"static\" was actually supposed to be a submodule.\nIf you want to force Git to treat `.git` as a regular file (which is\nhighly unusual and not recommended), you could potentially use `git add\n--force static/.git`. But again, this goes against Git's design principles\nand could lead to issues down the line. It's generally better to work with\nGit's model of repositories and submodules rather than trying to go against it.\n      \n    \n  \n\nOkay, this is going nowhere.  There's probably a low-level way to do this...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nNope, it doesn't work.  Couldn't it be done manually via \"plumbing\" lower-level\ncommands?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's generally not a good idea to manipulate Git internals directly, as this\ncan lead to unexpected behavior and can be difficult to troubleshoot. However,\nif you still want to try adding the `.git` file manually, you could use\nGit's low-level \"plumbing\" commands to do so, but proceed with caution.\nHere is an example of how you might do it:\n\n\n Create a blob object for the `.git` file:\ngit hash-object -w static/.git\n\nThis will return a hash, which you'll need to use in the next steps.\n\n\n\n Add the blob object to the index, using the `git update-index`\ncommand and the hash from the previous step:\ngit update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 &lt;hash&gt; static/.git\n\nReplace `&lt;hash&gt;` with the hash you got from step 1.\n\n\n\n Create a new commit with the updated index:\ngit commit -m \"Add .git file manually\"\n\n\nAgain, manipulating Git internals in this way can lead to unexpected behavior\nand is not recommended. This approach is provided for informational purposes\nonly and should be used at your own risk.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHow can I merge that into the commit that adds the submodules?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou can use Git's interactive rebase feature to combine the commits. This\nfeature allows you to edit, reorder, and squash (combine) commits. Here's how\nyou could do it:\n\n\n Start the interactive rebase with the `git rebase -i` command,\nspecifying the number of commits you want to go back. In your case, if you want\nto combine the last two commits, you would use `HEAD~2`:\ngit rebase -i HEAD~2\n\n\n\n\n This will open a text editor with a list of the last two commits,\neach on a separate line, with the word \"pick\" at the beginning of the line. The\ncommits are listed in reverse order, with the oldest commit at the top.\n\n To combine the commits, you need to replace \"pick\" with \"squash\" or\n\"s\" on the line with the commit you want to combine (in your case, the commit\nwhere you added the `.git` file manually). This tells Git to squash this\ncommit into the previous one.\n\n Save and close the text editor. Git will then combine the specified\ncommits into one and open a new text editor for you to create a new commit\nmessage for the combined commit.\n\n After you've entered the new commit message, save and close the text\neditor again. Git will then create the new combined commit.\nPlease note that this will rewrite your Git history. If you've already pushed\nyour commits to a remote repository, you'll need to force push with `git\npush -f` to update the remote repository with your new combined commit. Be\ncareful with this, as it can overwrite changes on the remote repository.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI don't trust this.  I'm sure that I can manually create an appropriate commit\nto check in \".git\" as a regular file, but there's a good chance that a rebase\noperation would return an error on that commit...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI suspect the rebase will fail with this \"invalid\" commit containing \".git\"\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt's possible that the interactive rebase could run into issues given the\nunconventional circumstances of your repository setup. However, it's hard to\npredict definitively without trying. If the rebase does fail, you can always\nabort it using `git rebase --abort` and your repository will go back to\nthe state it was in before you started the rebase.\nIf the rebase does fail, another possible workaround is to use the `git\nfilter-branch` command to modify the commit. This command is more complex\nand potentially dangerous than an interactive rebase, as it allows for\narbitrary modifications to your repository's history. However, it could\npotentially be used to add the \".git\" file to the commit where you added the\nsubmodules.\nHere's an example of how you could use `git filter-branch` to add a file\nto a past commit:\ngit filter-branch --tree-filter 'cp /path/to/.git /path/to/static/' HEAD\n\nThis command will rewrite every commit in your repository's history (from the\nmost recent commit back to the initial commit), running the specified shell\ncommand (in this case, `cp /path/to/.git /path/to/static/`) at each\ncommit.\nAs with an interactive rebase, `git filter-branch` will rewrite your\nrepository's history, so be careful if you've already pushed your commits to a\nremote repository. If you're not comfortable with `git filter-branch`,\nyou could consider creating a new commit that adds the \".git\" file, and then\nuse an interactive rebase to move that commit to the appropriate place in your\nhistory.\nPlease note that these are advanced Git techniques and should be used with\ncaution. Always make sure your work is backed up before attempting operations\nthat can modify your repository's history.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI should be able to use the plumbing commands to do the equivalent of \"git\ncommit --amend\" but in this case to add the hash to the commit as you\ndescribed.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you are correct. Git's lower-level \"plumbing\" commands can be used to\nmanually create and manipulate commits. For your case, the process would look\nsomething like this:\n\n\nUse `git ls-tree` to get a list of the objects in the commit you want\nto modify. This will give you a list of the blobs and trees (representing\nfiles and directories, respectively) in that commit.\n\n\nUse `git hash-object` to create a new blob object for the \".git\" file\nyou want to add. This will give you a hash that represents the new blob.\n\n\nUse `git mktree` to create a new tree object that includes the blobs\nand trees from step 1, as well as the new blob from step 2. This will give\nyou a hash that represents the new tree.\n\n\nUse `git commit-tree` to create a new commit object that has the same\nparent(s) and message as the original commit, but has the new tree from\nstep 3. This will give you a hash that represents the new commit.\n\n\nFinally, use `git update-ref` to update your branch to point to the\nnew commit.\n\n\nKeep in mind that these are very low-level operations that can be dangerous if\nnot used correctly. Always make sure your work is backed up before attempting\nto manually manipulate Git objects. Also, these operations will rewrite the\nhistory of your branch, so be careful if you've already pushed your commits to\na remote repository.\nHere is the rough sequence of commands to follow:\n# Step 1\ntree=$(git rev-parse HEAD^{tree})\n\n# Step 2\nblob=$(git hash-object -w static/.git)\n\n# Step 3\nnewtree=$(echo -e \"100644 blob $blob\\t.git\\n$(git ls-tree $tree)\" | git mktree)\n\n# Step 4\nparent=$(git rev-parse HEAD)\ncommit=$(git commit-tree -p $parent -m \"$(git log -1 --format=%B)\" $newtree)\n\n# Step 5\ngit update-ref refs/heads/main $commit\n\nNote: replace `main` with your branch name if it's different. And you\nwill need to replace static/.git with the correct path.\nThese commands are advanced and not often used in day-to-day Git operations.\nPlease proceed with caution.\n      \n    \n  \n\nI'm sure I could make this work, but I'm still not convinced that a rebase\nwould work across this commit.  Doesn't seem worth taking the chance.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIs there a way to make \"git status\" ignore the \"static\" directory here?\nOn branch main\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(use \"git restore ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modified:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public (modified content)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modified:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static (modified content)\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, there is a way to make Git ignore changes in a certain directory using the\n`.gitignore` file. However, this is not recommended for your case, as you\nwill be ignoring all changes to the `static` directory, which might not\nbe what you want.\nThe `git status` command is reporting that there is modified content in\nyour `static` directory because there is a change that is not staged for\na commit. This is a good thing, because it reminds you to commit any changes\nthat you might have forgotten about.\nIf you want to suppress this message, you can use the `-uno` option with\n`git status`, like so:\ngit status -uno\n\nThe `-uno` option tells `git status` to not show any untracked\nfiles. However, this will also hide any other untracked files in your\nrepository, not just those in the `static` directory.\nAgain, it's important to note that ignoring changes in a certain directory can\nlead to confusion and unexpected results, so use these options with caution.\nIt's generally better to resolve the cause of the unstaged changes rather than\ntrying to ignore them.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAdding files in the \"static\" folder will still be a problem if git doesn't\nthink they belong in the top-level repo.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIt appears there's some confusion here. The `static` directory is part of\nyour top-level repository and should be treated as such. Any files you add to\nthe `static` directory will be tracked by the top-level repository's Git.\nIf you have a `.git` file in your `static` directory that's causing\nGit to treat it as a submodule, that is the root of the issue. Submodules in\nGit are repositories within a repository, and they have their own separate\ntracking.\nIn order to properly track files within the `static` directory, you'll\nneed to ensure that it's not being treated as a submodule. This means removing\nthe `.git` file from the `static` directory.\nOnce you've done this, you should be able to add files to the `static`\ndirectory and have them tracked by your top-level repository without issue. If\nthere's still confusion about how to manage this, it may be helpful to consult\nwith a Git expert or further investigate Git's documentation on managing files\nand submodules.\n      \n    \n  \n\nWe're just going in circles here.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nBut I need the .git file there to generate \"public\" correctly.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI understand your situation better now. You are trying to have the `.git`\nfile in the `static` directory so that when Zola builds the site into the\n`public` directory (which is a submodule), the `.git` file is\ncorrectly included.\nWhile this is an unconventional setup, you can achieve this by using a\n`.gitignore` file in your main repository to ignore the `static`\ndirectory (or specifically the `static/.git` file). This will prevent the\nmain repository from treating `static` as a submodule or trying to track\nchanges in it.\nHowever, do note that any changes to the `static` directory or the\n`static/.git` file will not be tracked by your main repository. They will\nbe included in the `public` directory after Zola builds the site, and\nchanges there will be tracked by the submodule repository.\nHere's what you would do:\n\n\n In the main repository, create a `.gitignore` file if you\ndon't already have one.\n\n Add the following line to the `.gitignore` file:\n/static/.git\n\n\n\n\n Save and close the `.gitignore` file.\nNow, the `static/.git` file will be ignored by Git in the main\nrepository, but will still be copied over by Zola when it builds the site into\nthe `public` directory.\n\nRemember, this is a workaround and may not be the best practice for managing\nyour project. It would be best to consult with a Git expert or further\ninvestigate Git's documentation on managing files and submodules to find a\nsolution that fits your project's needs best.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I realized that I was dealing with an XY\nproblem and I needed to take a step back and\nreconsider my approach.  The real problem I needed to solve was to make sure\nthat the public/.git file would still exist after running zola build.\nChecking the file in as static/.git was a solution that came to mind, but\nthe problems it causes with Git aren't worth the trouble.  Continuing to focus\non fixing that solution wasn't helping.  I needed to solve the real problem.\nStarting a separate GPT-3.5 conversation...\nSince I was nearing the GPT-4 usage limit, I started a new ChatGPT conversation\nusing the GPT-3.5 model to discuss alternatives.  My first thought was to look\nfor a Zola post-build hook that I could use to recreate the public/.git\nfile...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDoes zola have any sort of automatic post-build hook that can run automatically\nafter \"zola build\"?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, Zola provides a feature called \"build hooks\" which allows you to execute a\ncommand or a script after the `zola build` command is completed.\nTo use build hooks, you need to add the `build.command` field to your\n`config.toml` file. The value of this field is the command you want to\nexecute after the build is completed. For example, if you want to copy some\nfiles to a specific location after the build is complete, you can add the\nfollowing to your `config.toml`:\n[build]\ncommand = \"cp -r /path/to/source /path/to/destination\"\n\nThis will copy the files from `/path/to/source` to\n`/path/to/destination` after the `zola build` command is executed.\nYou can replace the `cp` command with any command or script that you want\nto execute.\nNote that if the command you want to execute is more complex, it may be easier\nto put it into a shell script and call the script from the\n`build.command` field. For example:\n[build]\ncommand = \"bash /path/to/script.sh\"\n\nThis will execute the `script.sh` script after the build is completed.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhat working directory will the build command run in?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe build command specified in the `build.command` field will run in the\nroot directory of your Zola project.\nZola first changes the current working directory to the root directory of your\nproject before running the build command. This means that any relative paths in\nyour build command will be relative to the root directory of your project.\nFor example, if your build command is `python scripts/build.py`, and your\n`scripts` directory is located in the root directory of your project, the\nbuild command will run the `build.py` script located in\n`./scripts/build.py`.\nIt's important to note that if your build command includes any paths that are\nnot relative to the root directory of your project, you'll need to provide the\nfull absolute path or make sure that the paths are relative to the root\ndirectory of your project.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI added this to my \"config.toml\" but it didn't work.\n[build]\ncommand = \"echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\"\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe `build.command` field in your `config.toml` file looks correct.\nThe command you specified will create a `.git` file in the `public`\ndirectory with the contents `gitdir: ../.git/modules/public`.\nHowever, the `zola build` command doesn't actually run the build command\nspecified in your `config.toml` by default. To run the build command, you\nneed to pass the `--hook` flag when you run the `zola build`\ncommand.\nHere's an example command that should work for your configuration:\nzola build --hook\n\nThis will run the `echo` command specified in your `build.command`\nfield after the Zola build process is complete.\nAfter running this command, you should see a `.git` file in your\n`public` directory with the contents `gitdir:\n../.git/modules/public`.\n      \n    \n  \n\nNope, this didn't work.\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nzola build --hook\nerror: unexpected argument '--hook' found\n\nUsage: zola build [OPTIONS]\n\nFor more information, try '--help'.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `--hook` flag is no\nlonger available in the latest version of Zola.\nHowever, you can achieve the same result by using the `post-build` hook\nin your `config.toml` file. The `post-build` hook is a hook that\nruns after the build process is completed.\nHere's an updated example that should work for you:\n[build]\npost-build = [\"sh -c 'echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git'\"]\n\nThis will run the `echo` command after the build process is completed,\njust like the `--hook` flag would have done.\nAfter updating your `config.toml` file, you can run the `zola\nbuild` command as usual:\nzola build\n\nThis will trigger the `post-build` hook and run the `echo` command\nspecified in your `config.toml` file.\nI hope this helps!\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThat didn't do anything either.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI'm sorry to hear that the `post-build` hook didn't work for you either.\nHere are a few more things you can try:\n\n\n Double-check that the `config.toml` file you modified is the\ncorrect one for your Zola project. You should have a `config.toml` file\nin the root directory of your Zola project.\n\n Make sure that your `build` directory exists before running\nthe `zola build` command. If the `build` directory doesn't exist,\nZola will create it during the build process. However, if you want to execute a\ncommand after the build process is completed, you need to make sure that the\ndirectory exists before running the build command. You can create the\n`build` directory manually or by running the `zola init` command.\n\n Try using a different command in the `post-build` hook to see\nif the hook is being triggered at all. For example, you could try running the\n`ls` command to list the contents of the `build` directory after\nthe build process is completed:\n[build]\npost-build = [\"ls -l build\"]\n\nIf the `ls` command runs successfully after the `zola build`\ncommand is completed, then the `post-build` hook is working and the issue\nmay be with the command you're trying to run.\n\nI hope this helps you identify the issue!\n      \n    \n  \n\nTime to try another approach again...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat if I use a git hook?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, you can use a Git hook to execute a command after the `zola build`\ncommand is completed. A Git hook is a script that Git executes before or after\nan event, such as committing changes or pushing to a remote repository.\nHere's an example of how you can use a Git hook to run a command after the\n`zola build` command is completed:\n\n\n Create a new file in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Zola\nproject called `post-commit` (if it doesn't already exist). The\n`.git/hooks` directory is located in the root directory of your Git\nrepository.\ntouch .git/hooks/post-commit\n\n\n\n\n Make the file executable by running the following command:\nchmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit\n\n\n\n\n Open the `post-commit` file in a text editor and add the\nfollowing line:\n#!/bin/bash\nzola build &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\n\nThis script will first run the `zola build` command, and then execute the\n`echo` command to create a `.git` file in the `public`\ndirectory with the contents `gitdir: ../.git/modules/public`.\n\n\n\n Save the `post-commit` file and exit the text editor.\nNow, every time you commit changes to your Zola project, the\n`post-commit` hook will be triggered and the `zola build` and\n`echo` commands will be executed automatically.\n\nNote that this approach will only work if you have Git installed on your system\nand are using Git to manage your Zola project.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nwhat working directory does the post-commit hook run in?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe post-commit hook script runs in the root directory of your Git repository,\nwhich is also the root directory of your Zola project.\nWhen you execute the `git commit` command, Git changes the current\nworking directory to the root directory of your Git repository before executing\nthe post-commit hook script. This means that any relative paths in your\npost-commit hook script will be relative to the root directory of your Git\nrepository/Zola project.\nFor example, if your post-commit hook script contains the following command:\nzola build &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\n\nThe `zola build` command will run in the root directory of your Zola\nproject, and the `echo` command will create the `.git` file in the\n`public` directory of your Zola project.\nIt's important to keep in mind that any paths you use in your post-commit hook\nscript need to be relative to the root directory of your Zola project.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nDoes the .git/hooks/post-commit hook get committed to the repository itself (and pushed to remotes)?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nNo, the contents of the `.git/hooks` directory are not part of your Git\nrepository and are not committed or pushed to remote repositories.\nGit hooks are local to each repository clone, and are not stored in the\nrepository itself. When you clone a Git repository, the `.git/hooks`\ndirectory is created automatically, but it is not part of the repository's\nversion history.\nThis means that if you add a `post-commit` hook to your\n`.git/hooks` directory, it will only be available on your local machine\nand will not be automatically distributed to other users who clone your\nrepository.\nIf you want other users to use the same hook, you can provide them with the\ncontents of your hook script and instruct them to add it to their own\n`.git/hooks` directory. Alternatively, you can add the hook to your\nrepository's documentation and ask users to manually install the hook on their\nlocal machines.\nIt's worth noting that Git has several other types of hooks, such as pre-commit\nand pre-push hooks, that can help enforce policies and automate tasks for\ncollaborators on a project.\n      \n    \n  \n\nGPT-3.5 struggles to help.\nCompare the portion of the GPT-3.5 conversation below with the related GPT-4\nconveration that follows.  Both times, I present\nChatGPT with exactly the same git post-commit hook script and the same issues.\nGPT-3.5 tries to help but it struggles to come up with the right answers.\nInstead, much like the lists of invalid suggestions in the GPT-3.5 conversation\nabove, it suggests questionable solutions, such as adding a pre-commit hook\ninstead of fixing the post-commit hook or using a git subtree, ultimately\nveering off-topic...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHere's my post-commit hook at the moment:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\"\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYour `post-commit` hook looks good! Here's what each command in the hook does:\n\n\n`zola build`: This command runs the Zola build process, which\ngenerates your static site files in the `public` directory.\n\n\n`echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git`: This command\ncreates a `.git` file in the `public` directory with the\ncontents `gitdir: ../.git/modules/public`. This is necessary to tell Git\nthat the `public` directory is actually a submodule of the parent\nrepository.\n\n\n`cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\"`: These commands\nchange the current directory to the `public` directory, add all\nchanges to the Git index, and commit the changes with a commit message of \"zola\nbuild\".\n\n\nBy running these commands in the `post-commit` hook, you ensure that\nevery time you make a commit in your Git repository, your Zola site is rebuilt\nand the changes are automatically committed to the `public` directory as\na Git submodule.\nJust make sure that the `public` directory is already initialized as a\nGit repository before running the `git add` and `git commit`\ncommands. You can initialize the `public` directory as a Git repository\nby running the following command in the `public` directory:\ncd public\ngit init\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nIt works great, but only one little problem.  The submodule now shows as having\nchanges because the parent repository thinks it should have a different commit\nhash.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen you modify the `public` directory in the `post-commit` hook,\nit creates a new commit with a different commit hash in the `public` Git\nrepository. This causes the parent repository to show the `public`\nsubmodule as having changes.\nTo fix this, you can add the `--amend` option to the `git commit`\ncommand in your `post-commit` hook. This option modifies the previous\ncommit instead of creating a new one, effectively keeping the same commit hash.\nHere's an updated version of your `post-commit` hook with the\n`--amend` option added:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit --amend --no-edit\n\nWith this change, the `git commit` command will modify the previous\ncommit in the `public` repository instead of creating a new one. This\nwill ensure that the parent repository doesn't show the `public`\nsubmodule as having changes.\nNote that if you've already pushed the previous commits to a remote repository,\nyou'll need to force-push the amended commit to the remote repository to update\nthe commit history:\ngit push --force\n\nHowever, be careful when force-pushing as it can overwrite other collaborators'\nchanges. It's a good practice to communicate with your collaborators and make\nsure that it's okay to force-push changes to the repository.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAmending a previous commit always changes the commit hash unless the entire\ncommit is identical.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct, I apologize for the confusion. The `--amend` option\ncreates a new commit object that replaces the previous commit object with a new\none, even if the contents of the commit are identical. Therefore, the commit\nhash will be different.\nTo avoid changing the commit hash, you can use a Git subtree instead of a\nsubmodule to store the generated site files. A Git subtree is a method of\nintegrating a separate Git repository into a subdirectory of another\nrepository.\nHere's how you can use Git subtree to store your Zola-generated site files in a\n`public` directory:\n\n\n Create a new branch in your Git repository to hold the site files:\ngit branch site-files\n\n\n\n\n Switch to the new branch:\ngit checkout site-files\n\n\n\n\n Generate your site files using the `zola build` command:\nzola build\n\n\n\n\n Move the generated site files to a new `public` directory in\nthe root of your repository:\nmkdir public\nmv public/* public/.* public/\n\n\n\n\nCommit the changes to the `site-files` branch:\ngit add public\ngit commit -m \"Add site files\"\n\n\n\n\nSwitch back to the `master` branch:\ngit checkout master\n\n\n\n\nMerge the `site-files` branch into the `master` branch as a\nsubtree:\ngit subtree add --prefix=public/ site-files master --squash\n\n\nThis will create a new `public` directory in the `master` branch\nthat contains the generated site files from the `site-files` branch. The\n`--squash` option collapses all the commits in the `site-files`\nbranch into a single commit in the `master` branch.\nAfter this setup, you can modify your `post-commit` hook to simply run\nthe `zola build` command to regenerate the site files and commit the\nchanges to the `site-files` branch. The changes will be automatically\nmerged into the `master` branch as a subtree without changing the commit\nhash.\n      \n    \n  \n\nIt's amazing how many times ChatGPT generates numbered lists that are all the\nnumber 1.  This isn't an accident; I'm just reproducing the numbers it used!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're going off in the wrong direction entirely.  All I want to do is to\nautomate the process so that committing to the parent repository not only\nbuilds the zola site in the submodule directory and commits it, but also\ncommits the updated submodule hash in the parent commit.  I thought about doing\na commit --amend but that would run the post-commit hook again.  Maybe this\nshould just be a pre-commit hook instead?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion earlier. I understand what you're trying to\nachieve now.\nOne way to achieve this is to use a `pre-commit` hook instead of a\n`post-commit` hook. The `pre-commit` hook runs before the commit is\ncreated, so you can modify the `public` submodule and add the changes to\nthe Git index before the commit is created.\nHere's an example of what your `pre-commit` hook could look like:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public &amp;&amp; git commit --no-verify -m \"Update public submodule\"\n\nThis hook script does the following:\n\n\nRuns the `zola build` command to generate the site files in the\n`public` directory.\n\n\nCreates a `.git` file in the `public` directory to point to the\nGit repository for the `public` submodule.\n\n\nChanges the current directory to the `public` directory and adds all\nchanges to the Git index.\n\n\nChanges the current directory back to the root directory of your Zola\nproject and adds the `public` directory to the Git index as a\nsubmodule update.\n\n\nCommits the changes with a commit message of \"Update public submodule\" using\nthe `--no-verify` option to skip any other pre-commit hooks.\n\n\nBy using a `pre-commit` hook, you can ensure that the `public`\nsubmodule is updated and committed along with the parent repository changes.\nThis will also update the submodule hash in the parent commit automatically.\nNote that the `--no-verify` option is added to the `git commit`\ncommand to skip any other pre-commit hooks that might be configured. If you\nhave other pre-commit hooks that need to be run, you can remove this option.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI'd rather not create a separate commit for the submodule but just incorporate\nit into the commit being done that's causing the hook to run.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI understand your concern. To update the `public` submodule in the same\ncommit as the parent repository, you can use the `--patch` option with\nthe `git add` command in your `pre-commit` hook. The\n`--patch` option allows you to interactively select the changes to\ninclude in the Git index.\nHere's an updated version of your `pre-commit` hook with the\n`--patch` option added:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public --patch &amp;&amp; git commit --no-verify -m \"Update public submodule\"\n\nWith this change, the `git add public --patch` command will prompt you to\ninteractively select the changes to include in the Git index. You can use the\n`y` key to add a change, `n` to skip a change, and `q` to\nexit the patching process. Once you've selected the changes to include, the\n`git commit` command will create a new commit with both the parent\nrepository changes and the updated `public` submodule.\nNote that the `--no-verify` option is added to the `git commit`\ncommand to skip any other pre-commit hooks that might be configured. If you\nhave other pre-commit hooks that need to be run, you can remove this option.\nAlso, keep in mind that if you have collaborators working on the same\nrepository, they will need to use the same `pre-commit` hook script to\navoid merge conflicts when pushing their changes to the repository.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI'm getting errors like this:\nfatal: Unable to create '/home/deven/git/new/codereflections/public/.git/index.lock': Not a directory\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThis error occurs when Git is unable to create a lock file for the Git index in the `.git` directory of the `public` submodule. This could happen if the `.git` directory doesn't exist or is not a directory.\nTo fix this error, you can try the following steps:\n\n\n Ensure that the `public` directory exists and is initialized as a Git repository:\ncd public\ngit init\n\n\n\n\n Create a `.gitignore` file in the `public` directory with the following contents:\n# Ignore everything in the .git directory\n.git/*\n# Except the .gitignore file\n!.gitignore\n\nThis will ensure that Git ignores all files in the `.git` directory except for the `.gitignore` file.\n\n\n\n Add the `.gitignore` file to the Git index:\ngit add .gitignore\ngit commit -m \"Add .gitignore file\"\n\n\n\n\n Change the contents of your `pre-commit` hook to the following:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public --patch &amp;&amp; git commit --no-verify -m \"Update public submodule\"\n\nThis version of the hook skips the creation of the `.git` file in the `public` directory, as it is not necessary when using a Git submodule. It also removes the `--amend` option from the `git commit` command, which was causing the lock file error.\n\nBy using a Git submodule instead of a Git subtree, you can avoid some of the complexities and limitations of Git subtree. However, it's important to note that Git submodules can be a bit more complex to work with, especially when collaborating with other users on the same repository.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nRemember, public is a submodule, public/.git is a file, not a directory.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct, I apologize for the confusion. In a Git submodule, the `.git` directory is located in the root directory of the repository, not in the submodule directory.\nTo fix the error, you can modify your `pre-commit` hook to remove the `echo` command that creates the `.git` file in the `public` directory. This command is only necessary when using Git subtree, and it's not needed when using Git submodule.\nHere's an updated version of your `pre-commit` hook without the `echo` command:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public --patch &amp;&amp; git commit --no-verify -m \"Update public submodule\"\n\nWith this change, the `git add public --patch` command will prompt you to interactively select the changes to include in the Git index. You can use the `y` key to add a change, `n` to skip a change, and `q` to exit the patching process. Once you've selected the changes to include, the `git commit` command will create a new commit with both the parent repository changes and the updated `public` submodule.\nNote that the `--no-verify` option is added to the `git commit` command to skip any other pre-commit hooks that might be configured. If you have other pre-commit hooks that need to be run, you can remove this option.\nAlso, keep in mind that if you have collaborators working on the same repository, they will need to use the same `pre-commit` hook script to avoid merge conflicts when pushing their changes to the repository.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThe file is needed, otherwise git thinks I'm operating in the parent repository.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct, I apologize for the confusion. In a Git submodule, the `.git` file is necessary to tell Git that the `public` directory is a submodule and to point to the Git repository for the submodule.\nTo fix the error, you can modify your `pre-commit` hook to ensure that the `.git` file exists in the `public` directory before running the `git add` command. Here's an updated version of your `pre-commit` hook:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt; .git &amp;&amp; git add .git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public --patch &amp;&amp; git commit --no-verify -m \"Update public submodule\"\n\nWith this change, the `echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt; .git` command creates the `.git` file in the `public` directory with the contents `gitdir: ../.git/modules/public`. The `git add .git` command adds the `.git` file to the Git index, and the `git add .` command adds all changes in the `public` directory to the Git index.\nNote that the `--no-verify` option is added to the `git commit` command to skip any other pre-commit hooks that might be configured. If you have other pre-commit hooks that need to be run, you can remove this option.\nAlso, keep in mind that if you have collaborators working on the same repository, they will need to use the same `pre-commit` hook script to avoid merge conflicts when pushing their changes to the repository.\n      \n    \n  \n\nGPT-4 is much more helpful.\nChatGPT Plus has no usage limit on GPT-3.5, but GPT-4 is far more intelligent,\ncapable and useful.  At this point, I decided to briefly set the GPT-3.5\nconversation aside and go back to the GPT-4 conversation for more useful\nresponses.\nCompare the portion of the GPT-4 conversation below with the related GPT-3.5\nconversation above.  GPT-4 understands the\nsituation much better and immediately offers a good solution...\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI decided to solve the problem using a git post-commit hook instead, which runs\nthis script right now:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\"\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThat is a clever solution! The post-commit hook will build your Zola site,\nensure the `.git` file is properly placed in the `public` directory\n(which is a submodule), and then stage and commit all changes in the\n`public` directory after each commit in your main repository. This will\nkeep your `public` directory in sync with your main repository.\nJust a few things to consider:\n\n\nMake sure your script can handle errors properly. If for some reason the\n`zola build` command fails, you probably don't want the rest of the\nscript to continue executing.\n\n\nIt's important to remember that hooks are local to your Git repository and\nare not versioned. This means that if you clone your repository elsewhere,\nthe hooks won't be included. You'll need to manually set up the hooks in each\nclone of your repository.\n\n\nEnsure the script has the correct permissions to run. You might need to run\n`chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit` to make your script executable.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this script may slow down your commit process, especially\nif your website gets large and takes a while to build with Zola. However, if\nyou're the only one working on this repository and you're okay with this delay,\nit shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\nRemember to always thoroughly test your scripts to ensure they're working as\nexpected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThe &amp;&amp; operator will terminate the chain of commands early if any of them fail.\nSince the hooks are local, I committed it to the root of the repository and\nmade \".git/hooks/post-comment\" be a symlink to it.  I made the mode 755.  I\ntested a commit, it worked.  I'm not concerned with the delay; I'm only\ncommitting a new post when I'm finished with it and I'll need to build it for\nthe post to go live regardless.\nThe only concern I have at the moment is the fact that making this new commit\nin the submodule makes the top-level repository think that the submodule has\nthe wrong version.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAh, I see the concern. When the post-commit hook runs and makes a new commit in\nthe submodule, the top-level repository's reference to the submodule becomes\n\"detached\" because it's still pointing at the commit that was current when you\nlast updated the submodule reference in the top-level repository.\nThis is why you're seeing a message indicating that the submodule is at a\ndifferent commit than what the top-level repository expects. You're committing\ndirectly in the submodule, but the top-level repository isn't aware of these\nchanges.\nThe simplest way to resolve this is to add a command to your post-commit hook\nthat stages the updated submodule in the top-level repository and commits it.\nThat way, the top-level repository is always aware of the latest commit in the\nsubmodule. Here's what your updated post-commit hook might look like:\n#!/bin/sh\nzola build &amp;&amp; \\\necho gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git &amp;&amp; \\\ncd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\" &amp;&amp; \\\ncd .. &amp;&amp; git add public &amp;&amp; git commit --amend --no-edit\n\nThe `cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public &amp;&amp; git commit --amend --no-edit` part goes\nback to the top-level repository, stages the updated submodule, and amends the\nmost recent commit without changing its commit message. This way, the top-level\nrepository always points to the latest commit in the submodule. This should\nprevent the \"modified content\" message you're seeing.\nPlease test this updated script to ensure it works for your needs. And\nremember, this amends the most recent commit in the top-level repository. If\nyou're working with others or pushing these commits to a remote repository,\nyou'll need to be careful about modifying published history.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nYour addition is fine except that it will run the post-commit hook again\nrecursively.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI see your point. Running a commit in a post-commit hook would indeed cause the\nhook to run again, potentially creating an infinite loop.\nYou could prevent this by setting a variable in the environment of the commit\ncommand that tells the hook not to run again. Then, in the hook itself, you can\ncheck for this variable and exit early if it's set.\nHere's an example of how you could modify your hook to achieve this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" = \"1\" ]; then\n  exit 0\nfi\n\nzola build &amp;&amp; \\\necho gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git &amp;&amp; \\\ncd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\" &amp;&amp; \\\ncd .. &amp;&amp; git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\n\nThis way, when the `git commit` command is run with\n`SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1`, the hook will exit early and not run again. This\nprevents the infinite recursion.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nFinal script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n&nbsp;&nbsp;zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\" &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nGreat! This script should do what you want. It will:\n\n\nBuild your site with Zola.\n\n\nEcho the `gitdir` configuration into `.git` in the public\ndirectory.\n\n\nChange to the `public` directory and commit all changes with the\nmessage \"zola build\".\n\n\nAdd the `public` directory to the top-level repository.\n\n\nAmend the last commit without changing its message, setting the\n`SKIP_POST_COMMIT` environment variable to prevent the hook from\nrunning again.\n\n\nThis should keep your `public` directory in sync with your main site\ncontent, automatically committing changes whenever you commit in your main\nrepository. Remember to make your script executable (`chmod +x\npost-commit`) and double-check that it's located in the `.git/hooks`\ndirectory of your repository.\nAlso, keep in mind that this setup might not be ideal for everyone. It's quite\nspecific to your workflow and could cause confusion for other developers. If\nyou plan on having others contribute to your repository, make sure to document\nhow this setup works.\n      \n    \n  \n\nBack to the GPT-3.5 conversation again...\nNow I had a post-commit hook that looked correct, and worked as expected\nwhen running the script manually.  However, the same script inexplicably failed\nwhen triggered automatically by the git commit command.  To conserve GPT-4\nusage, I decided to try the GPT-3.5 conversation to investigate this unexpected\nerror.  In retrospect, I should've just stuck with GPT-4 instead!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhen my post-commit hook runs automatically, it gets this error:\nfatal: Unable to create '/home/deven/git/new/codereflections/public/.git/index.lock': Not a directory\nIf I run it manually after that, it works fine:\n$ ./post-commit\nAlready on 'main'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\nBuilding site...\nChecking all internal links with anchors.\n&gt; Successfully checked 0 internal link(s) with anchors.\n-&gt; Creating 3 pages (0 orphan) and 0 sections\nDone in 1.5s.\n\n[main 1809c5c] zola build\n&nbsp;14 files changed, 2212 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)\n&nbsp;create mode 100644 2023/04/21/how-the-sausage-is-made/index.html\n&nbsp;rewrite search_index.en.js (74%)\n[main 8e11fd4] Add blog post #3: \"How the sausage is made.\"\n&nbsp;Date: Sat Apr 22 01:05:07 2023 -0400\n&nbsp;2 files changed, 1019 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n&nbsp;create mode 100644 content/20230421-how-the-sausage-is-made.md\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe error message \"fatal: Unable to create '/home/deven/git/new/codereflections/public/.git/index.lock': Not a directory\" indicates that Git is trying to create a lock file in the `.git` directory of the `public` submodule, but it's failing because the directory doesn't exist.\nIt's possible that the `zola build` command is creating a new `public` directory when it runs, but the `git` command in the post-commit hook is assuming that the directory already exists. To fix this, you can modify your post-commit hook to ensure that the `public` directory exists before running any Git commands.\nHere's an example post-commit hook that checks if the `public` directory exists and creates it if necessary:\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ ! -d \"public\" ]; then\n  git submodule update --init --recursive\nfi\nzola build &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; echo gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt; .git &amp;&amp; git add .git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public --patch &amp;&amp; git commit --no-verify -m \"Update public submodule\"\n\nThe `if` statement checks if the `public` directory exists. If it doesn't exist, the `git submodule update --init --recursive` command is run to initialize and update the submodule.\nThe rest of the post-commit hook is the same as before, except that it assumes that the `public` directory exists.\nWith this change, the post-commit hook should be able to run without errors and automatically update the `public` submodule.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThink about this.  The problem is that \"public/.git\" is a file, not a directory.  I'm using the echo command to make sure of that, because this is a submodule.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct, I apologize for the confusion. The `public/.git` file is necessary in a Git submodule to tell Git where the Git repository for the submodule is located.\nThe error message you're seeing indicates that Git is trying to create a lock file in the `.git` directory of the `public` submodule, but it's failing because the directory doesn't exist.\nTo fix this, you can modify your post-commit hook to ensure that the `.git` file exists in the `public` directory before running any Git commands. Here's an updated version of your post-commit hook that should work:\n#!/bin/sh\nif [ ! -f \"public/.git\" ]; then\n  echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt; public/.git\nfi\nzola build &amp;&amp; cd public &amp;&amp; git add .git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; git add public --patch &amp;&amp; git commit --no-verify -m \"Update public submodule\"\n\nThe `if` statement checks if the `.git` file exists in the `public` directory. If it doesn't exist, the `echo` command is run to create the file with the contents `gitdir: ../.git/modules/public`.\nThe rest of the post-commit hook is the same as before, except that it assumes that the `.git` file exists in the `public` directory.\nWith this change, the post-commit hook should be able to run without errors and automatically update the `public` submodule.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nAgain, here is my post-commit hook:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cd public &amp;&amp; echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git switch main &amp;&amp; git reset) &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cd public &amp;&amp; echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\nWhether the \"public/.git\" file exists or not, this will create or overwrite it with the proper content before running the \"git switch\", yet the \"git switch\" is still trying to use \"public/.git\" as a directory.  What does it do that when git runs the hook automatically, but doesn't do that when I run the hook manually?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion. The error message you're seeing indicates that Git is trying to use `public/.git` as a directory, but it's failing because the file exists instead.\nThe problem is likely caused by the `git switch` command, which is designed to work with Git repositories and not submodules. When you run the post-commit hook manually, you may be running it from the parent repository, which is why it's working without errors.\nTo fix this, you can modify your post-commit hook to use the `git -C` option to specify the submodule directory when running Git commands. Here's an updated version of your post-commit hook that should work:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n    git -C public rev-parse || git submodule update --init --recursive\n    zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public switch main &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public reset &amp;&amp; \\\n    echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt; public/.git &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public add . &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public commit -m \"zola build\" &amp;&amp; \\\n    git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nThe `git -C public` option specifies that the Git command should be run in the `public` directory, rather than the parent repository. The `rev-parse` command is used to check if the submodule is initialized, and if not, the `submodule update --init --recursive` command is run.\nThe rest of the post-commit hook is the same as before, except that it uses `git -C public` to run Git commands in the `public` submodule.\nWith this change, the post-commit hook should be able to run without errors and automatically update the `public` submodule.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nYes, I'm starting in the parent repository.  Isn't that where the hook itself runs?  (Or is it in the \".git\" directory?)  I was in a subshell and running after the \"cd public\".  Because of the &amp;&amp; operators, it has to succeed to get to the \"git switch\" command giving the error.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct that the post-commit hook runs in the context of the parent repository, so the `git switch` command may not work correctly with the `public/.git` file in the submodule.\nWhen you run the post-commit hook manually from the command line, you may be running it from the parent repository or from within the `public` directory, which is why it's working without errors.\nOne way to ensure that the post-commit hook works correctly is to use the `git -C` option to specify the submodule directory when running Git commands, as I suggested in my previous response. This will ensure that Git commands are run in the correct context, regardless of where the post-commit hook is executed from.\nAnother option is to modify your post-commit hook to switch to the `public` directory before running the `git switch` command. Here's an example:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n    cd public &amp;&amp; \\\n    echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt; .git &amp;&amp; \\\n    git switch main &amp;&amp; \\\n    git reset &amp;&amp; \\\n    cd .. &amp;&amp; \\\n    git add public &amp;&amp; \\\n    SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nIn this version of the post-commit hook, the `cd public` command is used to switch to the `public` directory before running the `git switch` command. The `cd ..` command is then used to return to the parent directory before running the final `git add` and `git commit` commands.\nWith this change, the post-commit hook should be able to run without errors and automatically update the `public` submodule.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI'm starting in the parent repository root directory on purpose, since that's how git should be running the hook.  But the \"git switch\" command is in a subshell after the \"cd public\", so by the time that command runs, it should be in the public directory whether I run it manually or not.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct that the `git switch` command should be running in the `public` directory. If you're running the post-commit hook from the parent repository root directory, then the `cd public` command should put you in the correct directory before running the `git switch` command.\nIf you're still seeing the error \"fatal: Unable to create '/home/deven/git/new/codereflections/public/.git/index.lock': Not a directory\" when running the post-commit hook automatically, it's possible that there's an issue with how the Git repository and submodule are set up.\nOne thing to check is whether the `public` directory exists before running the post-commit hook. If the directory doesn't exist, then the `git switch` command will fail with the error you're seeing.\nYou can also try modifying your post-commit hook to use the `git -C` option to run Git commands in the `public` directory. Here's an example:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public rev-parse &amp;&amp; \\\n    echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt; public/.git &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public switch main &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public reset &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public add . &amp;&amp; \\\n    git -C public commit -m \"zola build\" &amp;&amp; \\\n    git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nIn this version of the post-commit hook, the `git -C public` option is used to specify the `public` directory when running Git commands. The `rev-parse` command is used to check if the submodule is initialized, and if not, the `submodule update --init --recursive` command is run.\nThe rest of the post-commit hook is the same as before, except that it uses `git -C public` to run Git commands in the `public` submodule.\nWith this change, the post-commit hook should be able to run without errors and automatically update the `public` submodule.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nThat rev-parse accomplishes nothing.  If the \"public/.git\" file is missing for the submodule, it will find the \".git\" directory in the parent report and still succeed.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYou're correct that the `git rev-parse` command I suggested may not be necessary, and that Git may find the `.git` directory in the parent repository instead of the `.git` file in the submodule directory.\nIf you're still experiencing errors with the post-commit hook, you may want to try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n\nCheck that the `public` directory exists and is a Git submodule. You can run the `git submodule status` command to list the submodules and their status.\n\n\nCheck that the `.git` file exists in the `public` directory, and that it contains the correct path to the Git repository for the submodule. You can run the `cat public/.git` command to view the contents of the `.git` file.\n\n\nCheck that the submodule is up to date with the latest changes in the parent repository. You can run the `git submodule update --init --recursive` command to ensure that the submodule is up to date.\n\n\nCheck that the post-commit hook is executable and has the correct permissions. You can run the `ls -l post-commit` command to view the file permissions, and the `chmod +x post-commit` command to make the file executable if needed.\n\n\nTry running the post-commit hook manually from the `public` directory to see if there are any errors. You can run the `cd public &amp;&amp; ./post-commit` command to run the post-commit hook from the `public` directory.\n\n\nIf you're still experiencing errors after these steps, you may want to consider reaching out to the Zola community or Git support for further assistance.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nReconsider my exact situation as previously explained and tell me for each of your suggestions, do they actually make sense?  Why or why not?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSure, I apologize for the confusion earlier. Based on your specific situation, here are my suggestions:\n\n\n Check that the `public` directory exists and is a Git submodule.\nThis is a valid suggestion, as the `public` directory needs to be a Git submodule for the post-commit hook to work correctly. You can run the `git submodule status` command to check the status of the submodule.\n\n\n\n Check that the `.git` file exists in the `public` directory, and that it contains the correct path to the Git repository for the submodule.\nThis suggestion is also valid, as the `.git` file in the `public` directory is necessary for Git to treat the directory as a submodule. You can run the `cat public/.git` command to view the contents of the `.git` file.\n\n\n\n Check that the submodule is up to date with the latest changes in the parent repository.\nThis suggestion is also valid, as the submodule needs to be up to date with the latest changes in the parent repository for the post-commit hook to work correctly. You can run the `git submodule update --init --recursive` command to update the submodule.\n\n\n\n Check that the post-commit hook is executable and has the correct permissions.\nThis suggestion is also valid, as the post-commit hook needs to be executable for Git to run it automatically. You can run the `ls -l post-commit` command to view the file permissions, and the `chmod +x post-commit` command to make the file executable if needed.\n\n\n\n Try running the post-commit hook manually from the `public` directory to see if there are any errors.\nThis suggestion may not be necessary in your specific situation, as the post-commit hook should be run automatically from the parent directory. However, running the post-commit hook manually from the `public` directory can help identify any errors or issues with the hook.\n\nI hope this clarifies my earlier suggestions, and please let me know if you have any further questions.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n(1) is not a valid suggestion.  We've already established that the \"public\" directory exists, because the \"cd public\" command in the subshell had to succeed for the \"git switch\" to even run in the first place.\n(2) is not a valid suggestion.  The next command in the subshell after \"cd public\" is the echo command to create or overwrite the \"public/.git\" file.  Because of the &amp;&amp; operators, this command also must succeed because the \"git switch\" command DOES run.\n(3) is not a valid suggestion.  The submodule doesn't need to be up to date with anything, because the later \"zola build\" command will recreate the \"public\" directory from scratch, so it doesn't matter what it contained before.\n(4) is barely a valid suggestion.  I said that running the hook manually was successful; that implies that I already have correct executable permissions on the script.  (Technically, I could have manually run \"sh post-commit\" if it didn't, but come on.)\n(5) is not a valid suggestion.  The hook is not meant to start in the public directory.  If it does, the \"cd public\" command would fail.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the confusion in my previous message. Based on your specific situation, here's my updated response to your questions:\n\n\n Check that the `public` directory exists and is a Git submodule.\nYou're correct that this is not a valid suggestion, as the `public` directory exists and is a submodule. The `cd public` command in the subshell confirms that the `public` directory exists and can be accessed.\n\n\n\n Check that the `.git` file exists in the `public` directory, and that it contains the correct path to the Git repository for the submodule.\nYou're correct that this is not a valid suggestion, as the `echo` command in the subshell creates or overwrites the `.git` file in the `public` directory. This command confirms that the `.git` file exists and contains the correct path to the submodule.\n\n\n\n Check that the submodule is up to date with the latest changes in the parent repository.\nYou're correct that this is not a valid suggestion, as the `zola build` command will recreate the `public` directory and its contents from scratch. This command does not require the submodule to be up to date with the latest changes in the parent repository.\n\n\n\n Check that the post-commit hook is executable and has the correct permissions.\nYou're correct that this is a valid suggestion, but as you mentioned, running the post-commit hook manually confirms that the script has the correct executable permissions. It's possible that this suggestion is not relevant to your specific situation.\n\n\n\n Try running the post-commit hook manually from the `public` directory to see if there are any errors.\nYou're correct that this is not a valid suggestion, as the post-commit hook is designed to run automatically from the parent directory. Running the post-commit hook manually from the `public` directory is not necessary, and may not be relevant to your specific situation.\n\nI hope this updated response is more helpful, and please let me know if you have any further questions.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nSo, do you have any useful suggestions for debugging this fatal error?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nYes, here are some suggestions for debugging the `fatal: Unable to create '/home/deven/git/new/codereflections/public/.git/index.lock': Not a directory` error in your post-commit hook:\n\n\nCheck that the `public` directory is not a file, but a directory. You can run the `ls -l public` command to verify that the `public` directory is indeed a directory, and not a file with the same name.\n\n\nCheck that the `public` directory is empty, or contains only the `.git` file. The `zola build` command will recreate the `public` directory from scratch, so it's important that the directory is empty or contains only the `.git` file. You can run the `ls public` command to verify the contents of the `public` directory.\n\n\nCheck that the `public` directory has the correct permissions. It's possible that the `public` directory has incorrect permissions that prevent Git from creating the `.git/index.lock` file. You can run the `ls -ld public` command to view the permissions of the `public` directory, and the `chmod` command to change the permissions if needed.\n\n\nCheck that the parent repository has the correct permissions. It's possible that the parent repository has incorrect permissions that prevent Git from accessing or modifying the `public` directory. You can run the `ls -ld .` command in the parent repository to view the permissions of the parent directory, and the `chmod` command to change the permissions if needed.\n\n\nTry running the `zola build` command and the `git add` command manually from the `public` directory to see if there are any errors. This can help identify any issues with the `public` directory that may be causing the `fatal` error.\n\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful in identifying the source of the error, and please let me know if you have any further questions.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHere we go again.  (1) is invalid, as we've already discussed.  \"cd public\" succeeds.  (2) is invalid, since there is no need for the directory to be empty; \"zola build\" will clobber anything in that directory.  (3) is invalid; if the permissions were wrong, running the script manually would fail also.  The error trying to create \".git/index.lock\" is because the \"public/.git\" path is a file with the submodule reference, not a directory that can contain an \"index.lock\" file.  (4) is invalid.  Again, if the permissions were bad, running the script manually would also fail.  (5) is invalid.  The error occurs with the \"git switch\" command before \"zola build\" even runs.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for the repeated suggestions that were not helpful. Here are some additional suggestions to help with the issue:\n\n\nCheck that the `.git` file in the `public` directory is a plain text file that contains the submodule reference. You can use the `cat public/.git` command to view the contents of the file and confirm that it is a plain text file.\n\n\nCheck that the submodule is properly initialized in the parent repository. You can use the `git submodule status` command to view the status of the submodule and ensure that it is properly initialized and up to date with the latest changes in the submodule repository.\n\n\nTry running the `git switch` command manually from the parent repository directory to see if there are any errors. This can help identify any issues with the `git switch` command that may be causing the error.\n\n\nTry using the `git submodule update` command to update the submodule in the parent repository. This can help ensure that the submodule is properly initialized and up to date with the latest changes in the submodule repository.\n\n\nCheck that the `public` directory is included in the `.gitignore` file in the parent repository. If the `public` directory is included in the `.gitignore` file, this can prevent Git from tracking changes in the `public` directory and may help prevent the `fatal` error.\n\n\nI hope these suggestions are more helpful in resolving the issue, and please let me know if you have any further questions.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n(1) is invalid; the echo command confirms this is true already.  (2) is only partially valid; the submodule is properly initialized (I've checked), and it doesn't need to be up to date since \"zola build\" regenerates the entire directory. (3) is invalid; I'm trying to make sure the submodule is on the main branch, not the parent repository. (4) is invalid; the submodule is initialized and -- as previously discussed -- does not need to be up to date.  (5) is a valid suggestion, but there is no \".gitignore\" file, so that's not an issue.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThank you for the clarification. Here are some additional suggestions:\n\n\nCheck that the submodule is properly initialized in the parent repository. You can use the `git submodule status` command to view the status of the submodule and ensure that it is properly initialized and up to date with the latest changes in the submodule repository.\n\n\nTry using the `git submodule update` command to update the submodule in the parent repository. This can help ensure that the submodule is properly initialized and up to date with the latest changes in the submodule repository.\n\n\nCheck that the `public` directory is not listed in the `.gitignore` file in the parent repository. If the `public` directory is listed in the `.gitignore` file, this can prevent Git from tracking changes in the `public` directory and may help prevent the `fatal` error.\n\n\nTry using the `git submodule foreach` command to run the `git switch main` command in the `public` submodule directory. This can help ensure that the submodule is on the correct branch and prevent any issues with the `git switch` command failing in the post-commit hook.\n\n\nTry using the `git submodule foreach` command to run the `git reset` command in the `public` submodule directory. This can help ensure that any changes in the `public` submodule are reset and prevent any issues with the `git add` command failing in the post-commit hook.\n\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful in resolving the issue, and please let me know if you have any further questions.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nYou're mostly repeating previous invalid suggestions.  \"git submodule foreach\" is interesting (hadn't seen that subcommand) but not really helpful.  I have another submodule for the DeepThought theme and I don't want to touch that one.  Besides, how does \"git submodule foreach\" accomplish anything different from using \"cd public\" in a subshell before running the git commands?\nHow do I check if I'm already on the \"main\" branch?  I can just skip the \"git switch\" command if I am.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI apologize for repeating previous suggestions.\nYou can check if you are on the \"main\" branch in the submodule by using the `git branch` command. Running `git branch` in the `public` directory will display a list of local branches, and the currently active branch will be indicated with an asterisk (*) next to the branch name. You can then use a conditional statement in your post-commit hook to skip the `git switch` command if you are already on the \"main\" branch.\nFor example, you can modify your post-commit hook as follows to skip the `git switch` command if you are already on the \"main\" branch:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n    (cd public &amp;&amp; echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git reset) &amp;&amp; \\\n    if [ $(cd public &amp;&amp; git branch --show-current) != \"main\" ]; then \\\n        (cd public &amp;&amp; git switch main) \\\n    fi &amp;&amp; \\\n    zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n    (cd public &amp;&amp; echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n    git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nThis modified post-commit hook will first check if you are already on the \"main\" branch in the `public` submodule before running the `git switch` command. If you are already on the \"main\" branch, the `git switch` command will be skipped.\n      \n    \n  \n\nAt this point, I was tired of arguing with ChatGPT about this error, while\nmaking no progress towards a solution, so I set ChatGPT aside and just debugged\nit myself.  Running strace -f git commit showed that the failing system call\nwas attempting to create a public/.git/index.lock file, which failed with the\n\"Not a directory\" error because public/.git was indeed not a directory --\njust as the error message said!\nRunning the script manually was always successful.  Running it automatically\nvia the git commit command always failed.  Finally, I realized that the only\nreasonable explanation must be related to some unknown difference between the\nenvironment variables in each context.  Therefore, I added env to the script\nto dump the environment, captured the results from each context, and compared\nthem.  One environment variable jumped out at me: GIT_INDEX_FILE\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI finally figured out what was actually wrong and why it was only working from the command line.  When running the git hook automatically, git added GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/index to the environment!\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nAh, I see. Thank you for letting me know. That explains why the `git switch` command was failing with the \"Not a directory\" error in the post-commit hook when running it automatically.\nAdding `GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/index` to the environment is not uncommon when running Git commands in a script or hook, as it specifies the location of the Git index file to use. However, it can cause issues with some commands that expect a directory path, such as `git switch`.\nI'm glad you were able to identify the issue and resolve it. If you have any further questions or issues, please don't hesitate to ask.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHere's my final version of \"post-commit\", hopefully:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nunset GIT_INDEX_FILE\n\ngitdir=\"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\"\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cd public &amp;&amp; echo $gitdir &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git switch main &amp;&amp; git reset) &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cd public &amp;&amp; echo $gitdir &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThis looks good to me!\nThis modified version of your post-commit hook sets `GIT_INDEX_FILE` to an empty value, effectively unsetting it, to ensure that Git commands use the default index file in the `.git` directory.\nThe `gitdir` variable is defined to contain the submodule reference, which is then used in the `echo` command to create or overwrite the `.git` file in the `public` directory.\nThe `git switch` command is used to switch to the `main` branch in the `public` submodule before resetting it, which will ensure that the submodule is on the correct branch.\nThe `zola build` command is then used to build the site in the `public` directory, after which the changes are committed and pushed to the submodule's repository.\nFinally, the `git add` command is used to stage the changes in the `public` submodule, followed by a `git commit --amend` command to amend the previous commit with the changes to the submodule.\nThis modified post-commit hook should work as intended, automating the process of building the site in the `public` submodule and committing the changes.\n      \n    \n  \n\nBack to the GPT-4 conversation.\nI decided that I would rather suffer the GPT-4 usage limits (50 messages per 3\nhours) than to suffer the inferior results from GPT-3.5, so I switched back to\nusing the GPT-4 conversation.\nNow I have a working post-commit hook which solves the original problem and\nautomates the zola build command to boot.  Might as well automate the git push command for the submodule too!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nWhat's the best way to also add a push hook so that pushing changes to the\ntop-level repository will trigger a push of the submodule?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo automatically push changes in your `public` submodule whenever you\npush changes in your main repository, you can add a `pre-push` Git hook.\nThis hook runs before the `git push` command is executed.\nFirst, you need to create a new file in your `.git/hooks` directory named\n`pre-push`. Open it in a text editor and add the following script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncd public &amp;&amp; git push\n\nSave and close the file, then make it executable by running the command\n`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`.\nThis script will navigate to your `public` submodule directory and push\nany changes before the main repository is pushed. Remember that if there are\nuncommitted changes in the submodule, the push command will fail. So, make sure\nto commit any changes in the submodule before pushing.\nLastly, keep in mind that this setup is quite specific to your workflow and\ncould cause confusion for other developers. Make sure to document how this\nsetup works if others contribute to your repository.\n      \n    \n  \n\nYeah, that is definitely the easy one.  Thinking about the post-commit hook\nagain, it occurred to me that the top-level .git directory could still have\nstate information about the submodule, even after Zola blows away the public\nsubdirectory and recreates it.  Might as well take that into account, despite\nthe fact that it's probably unlikely to happen!\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nHmm, in the post-commit hook, I should probably do something like (cd public &amp;&amp;\ngit checkout main &amp;&amp; git reset --hard) or something to make sure it's starting\nfrom a clean baseline state before running zola build?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIndeed, ensuring that your submodule is in a clean state before making new\ncommits is a good idea. Resetting the branch to the latest commit can help\navoid confusion and potential errors.\nHere's how you could modify your script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git checkout main &amp;&amp; git reset --hard) &amp;&amp; \\\n  zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n  echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\" &amp;&amp; \\\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n  git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nThis script first navigates to the `public` directory, checks out the\n`main` branch, and resets any uncommitted changes. Then it continues with\nthe rest of your operations as before.\nKeep in mind that `git reset --hard` is a destructive operation that will\npermanently discard any uncommitted changes. So, it's important to ensure that\nthere is no valuable work in progress in the `public` submodule when the\nscript is run.\nAs always, make sure to thoroughly test the script to ensure it behaves as\nexpected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nZola will blow away the public directory immediately when it starts its build\nprocess anyway, so the \"git reset --hard\" can't do any more damage as long as\nit's run inside the \"public\" directory.  What I want to do is to make sure I\ncommit the generated files to the main branch, and a \"git submodule update\"\nwould leave the submodule in a detached state.  I also want to make sure\nanything that might be staged in the index is cleared from the index too, which\nmay still need another command added.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nIf you want to ensure that your `public` submodule is in a clean state\nbefore starting the build process, you can use `git clean -fd` in\naddition to `git reset --hard`. The `clean` command will remove any\nuntracked files and directories, while the `reset` command will discard\nany uncommitted changes.\nHere's how your script could look:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git checkout main &amp;&amp; git reset --hard &amp;&amp; git clean -fd) &amp;&amp; \\\n  zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n  echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\" &amp;&amp; \\\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n  git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nAs usual, ensure to thoroughly test the script to make sure it behaves as\nexpected. Also, be aware that `git clean -fd` is a destructive operation\nthat will permanently remove untracked files and directories, so be careful\nwhen using it.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nI don't need to clean the working directory itself; zola will do that.  I just\nwant to make sure that I'm on the main branch and the index is empty.  Since\nthe entire public directory will be destroyed by zola, I'm only concerned about\nthe submodule state within the top-level .git directory.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nI see, if you're just concerned about the state of the submodule within the\ntop-level .git directory, and you want to make sure you're on the main branch\nwith an empty index, you can use the `git reset` and `git checkout`\ncommands.\nThe `git reset` command can be used with the `--hard` option to\nreset the index and working directory to match the `HEAD` commit. The\n`git checkout` command can be used to switch to the `main` branch.\nHere's what your script might look like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git checkout main &amp;&amp; git reset --hard) &amp;&amp; \\\n  zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n  echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\" &amp;&amp; \\\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n  git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nThis script will ensure that before building with zola, you're always on the\n`main` branch of the `public` submodule, with a clean index. After\nbuilding, it will commit any changes in the `public` submodule, and then\nupdate the top-level repository to reflect the new commit in the submodule.\nAs always, make sure to thoroughly test your scripts to ensure they behave as\nexpected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nInstead of \"git reset --hard\", how do I just reset the index only?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nTo reset the index only, you can use the `git reset` command without any\nadditional options. This will reset the index to match the `HEAD` commit\nwithout affecting the working directory:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git checkout main &amp;&amp; git reset) &amp;&amp; \\\n  zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n  echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public &gt;public/.git\" &amp;&amp; \\\n  (cd public &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n  git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\nIn this script, `(cd public &amp;&amp; git checkout main &amp;&amp; git reset)` will\nswitch to the `main` branch of the `public` submodule and reset the\nindex to match the `HEAD` commit, without affecting the working\ndirectory. After building with zola, the script will commit any changes in the\n`public` submodule and update the top-level repository to reflect the new\ncommit in the submodule.\nAs always, make sure to thoroughly test your scripts to ensure they behave as\nexpected.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nWhat would be the difference between \"git checkout main\" and \"git switch main\"?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe `git switch` command was introduced in Git 2.23.0 as a more intuitive\nway to switch between branches. It essentially separates the \"switching\nbranches\" and \"creating branches\" functions from the `git checkout`\ncommand.\nThe `git switch` command is designed to switch branches in a safe way,\npreventing accidental overwriting of local changes. It refuses to run if there\nare uncommitted changes, unless you use the `-m` option to merge the\nchanges into the new branch, or `-d` to discard them.\nOn the other hand, `git checkout` can be used for both switching branches\nand checking out files, which can lead to confusion and potentially dangerous\nsituations if you have uncommitted changes and you try to switch branches.\nIn your context:\n\n\n`git checkout main` would switch you to the `main` branch, but it\nmight overwrite uncommitted changes if there are any. This would depend on\nyour Git configuration and the specific state of your repository.\n\n\n`git switch main` would switch you to the `main` branch and\nrefuse to run if there are uncommitted changes, making it a safer option if\nyou want to prevent potential data loss.\n\n\nOverall, if you're using a version of Git that supports the `git switch`\ncommand, it's a safer and more intuitive command for switching branches\ncompared to `git checkout`.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nHow's this?\n#!/bin/sh\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cd public &amp;&amp; echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git switch main &amp;&amp; git reset) &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(cd public &amp;&amp; echo \"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\" &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThis script looks fine to me. It should successfully:\n\n\nChange to the `public` directory, set up the `.git` file, switch\nto the `main` branch, and reset the index (unstage any changes).\n\n\nRun `zola build` to generate the site in the `public` directory.\n\n\nChange to the `public` directory again, set up the `.git` file,\nadd all the changes to the index, and commit them with the message \"zola\nbuild\".\n\n\nIn the parent repository, add any changes in the `public` submodule to\nthe index and amend the last commit without changing the commit message,\nskipping the post-commit hook to avoid recursion.\n\n\nA couple of things to keep in mind:\n\n\nYou need to have the `SKIP_POST_COMMIT` environment variable exported\nin the shell where you're running the `git commit` command, or it\nshould be set in the same line before the command for it to have effect, as you\nhave done.\n\n\nThis script assumes that the initial state of the `public` repository\nis clean, i.e., there are no uncommitted changes when the script is run. If\nthere are uncommitted changes, the `git reset` command will unstage them,\nbut they will still be present in the working directory, and thus will be\nincluded when `zola build` is run and the resulting files are committed.\n\n\nIf there are often uncommitted changes in the `public` directory when\nthis script is run, you might want to consider modifying the script to handle\nthat situation.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \nZola build will blow away the existing public directory anyhow.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \nRight, I see. In that case, the `git reset` command in the `public`\ndirectory won't have much effect, since the `public` directory is deleted\nand recreated by `zola build`.\nYour script should work as expected then. It first ensures that `public`\nrepository is on the `main` branch, then builds the site with\n`zola`, commits the generated files in the `public` repository, and\nfinally updates the `public` submodule in the parent repository and\namends the last commit there.\nThe environment variable `SKIP_POST_COMMIT` is used to prevent recursive\nexecution of the post-commit hook when the script itself commits changes. This\nis a clever use of the environment and Git hooks.\nAs always, make sure to test your script thoroughly in your specific\nenvironment to confirm that it behaves as expected.\n      \n    \n  \n\nThe Solution\nHere's the solution that I came up with, based on the ChatGPT conversation\nabove:\n\n\n I created a GitHub repository for the blog source files and cloned\nit to my development system:\ngit clone https://github.com/code-reflections/codereflections.git\n\n\n I created a separate GitHub repository with a repository name\nsuitable to use for GitHub Pages, which I added to the first repository as a\nsubmodule, using \"public\" as the submodule directory:\ncd codereflections\ngit submodule add https://github.com/code-reflections/code-reflections.github.io.git public\ngit commit\n\nThis command creates the \"public\" subdirectory and clones the second repository\ninto that subdirectory as a submodule.  It also creates or updates the\n\".gitmodules\" file to record the new submodule.  The changes are then committed\nto the top-level repository.\n\n Note: The \"git submodule add\" command is only used for the\ninitial setup.  Cloning the repositories again in the future is done\ndifferently:\ngit clone https://github.com/code-reflections/codereflections.git\ncd codereflections\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n\n\n I created the following Git repository hook scripts in the top-level\nrepository working directory and committed them to the repository, so they\nwould be version controlled.\npost-commit\n#!/bin/sh\n\nunset GIT_INDEX_FILE\n\ngitdir=\"gitdir: ../.git/modules/public\"\n\nif [ -z \"$SKIP_POST_COMMIT\" ]; then\n    (cd public &amp;&amp; echo $gitdir &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git switch main &amp;&amp; git reset) &amp;&amp; \\\n    zola build &amp;&amp; \\\n    (cd public &amp;&amp; echo $gitdir &gt;.git &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"zola build\") &amp;&amp; \\\n    git add public &amp;&amp; SKIP_POST_COMMIT=1 git commit --amend --no-edit\nfi\n\npre-push\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncd public &amp;&amp; git switch main &amp;&amp; git push --force\n\n\n Finally, I added symbolic links from Git's hook directory to both of\nthese scripts to activate them.\ncd .git/hooks\nln -s ../../post-commit post-commit\nln -s ../../pre-push pre-push\n\nHow it works\n\n\n Make changes to the blog markdown content soure files in the\ntop-level repository.\n\n Run git commit to commit the changes to the top-level\nrepository.\n\n After the changes are committed, Git automatically runs the\npost-commit hook script to build the website and commit the generated files\nto the Git submodule:\n\n\n First, the script clears the GIT_INDEX_FILE environment variable,\nwhich was set automatically by Git.  This variable causes the \"Not a directory\"\nerrors discussed in the ChatGPT conversation above; clearing the variable\nprevents these errors.\n\n Next, the shell variable gitdir is set to the expected contents of\nthe public/.git file for the Git submodule.\n\n The rest of the code in the script is skipped if the environment\nvariable SKIP_POST_COMMIT is set.  This variable gets set by the script\nitself (see below), to prevent infinite recursion via the git commit command.\n\n Next, in a subshell (to avoid changing the current directory for the\nrest of the script), the script creates the public subdirectory if necessary,\nchanges to that subdirectory, writes the expected contents of the public/.git\nfile, switches to the main branch of the Git submodule and resets the Git index\nof the submodule.  (This guarantees a clean starting state.)\n\n Next, the script runs the zola build command.  Zola will\nautomatically delete the public subdirectory (and everything in it), if it\nexists, then create a new empty public subdirectory and populate it with all\nthe generated static files for the website.  (At this point, Git would not\nrecognize public as a valid Git submodule directory.)\n\n Next, in a subshell again, the script changes to the public\nsubdirectory, writes the expected contents of the public/.git file (creating\nthe missing file), stages all of the static website files generated by Zola,\nand commits them to the Git submodule.  (This necessarily changes the current\ncommit hash for the Git submodule, which would appear as unstaged changes in\nthe top-level repository.)\n\n Finally, the script stages the new commit hash of the Git submodule,\nsets the SKIP_POST_COMMIT environment variable to prevent infinite recursion,\nand runs git commit --amend --no-edit to modify the newly-created commit in\nthe top-level repository to update the Git submodule commit hash to match the\ngenerated files from that commit.\n\n\n Run git push to push the current commit in the top-level\nrepository to GitHub.\n\n Before pushing the new commit, Git automatically runs the pre-push\nhook script to push the generated static files in the Git submodule to GitHub:\n\n\n The script changes to the public subdirectory, switches to the\nmain branch of the Git submodule (just in case), and force-pushes the current\nHEAD of the main branch to GitHub.\n\n\n After the pre-push hook script finishes, Git actually pushes the\ncurrent commit in the top-level repository to GitHub.\n\nSummary\nGit submodules and Zola really don't want to play nice with each other, but\nthese two Git repository hook scripts can be used to cleanly and automatically\nintegrate Zola with a Git submodule, using a separate Git repository for the\ngenerated static website files, suitable for use with GitHub\nPages for free static website hosting!\n","id":"https://codereflections.com/2023/12/23/using-git-submodules-with-zola/","title":"Using Git submodules with Zola!"}},"docInfo":{"https://codereflections.com/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/18/welcome-to-codereflections/":{"body":615,"title":2},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/":{"body":2372,"title":2},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/20/how-the-sausage-is-made/":{"body":4014,"title":2},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/":{"body":4456,"title":3},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/":{"body":1678,"title":3},"https://codereflections.com/2023/04/23/choosing-a-comment-system/":{"body":2975,"title":3},"https://codereflections.com/2023/05/05/choosing-a-website-theme/":{"body":3418,"title":3},"https://codereflections.com/2023/05/13/fine-tuning-the-website-theme/":{"body":5829,"title":4},"https://codereflections.com/2023/06/23/formatting-chatgpt-conversations/":{"body":4531,"title":3},"https://codereflections.com/2023/06/24/trouble-with-dark-mode-theme/":{"body":3449,"title":4},"https://codereflections.com/2023/08/05/wrapping-up-the-origin-story/":{"body":4395,"title":4},"https://codereflections.com/2023/12/23/using-git-submodules-with-zola/":{"body":10225,"title":4}},"length":13},"lang":"English"};
